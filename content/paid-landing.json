Our bars, our laundries, our hot dog sellers and our delicatessens, our bodegas, our dollar stores, our hardware stores, hell, our haberdasheries. These businesses have served New York City with dignity and distinction since this city was built—some are quiet, others make noise; some last a week, or a month, while others have lasted over a century, and are still kicking."
