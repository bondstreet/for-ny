## Pintail Coffee at Georgia
One of the mandatory steps in my morning routine is visiting Pintail Coffee at Georgia - It’s right up the block from my apartment, super low key, and has my favorite iced coffee. Michael, who owns Pintail, will probably be playing reggae whenever I walk in. This, the surfboards, and stocking a juice brand called Summers provide me with a strong sense of home (I'm from Hawai’i). Occupying the same space as Pintail is Georgia (also the name of the shop’s owner) - a boutique with some of the best ‘60s & ‘70s vintage I've come across in the city. @georgianycvintage @pintailcoffeenyc @summersbrooklyn

## Coming Soon New York
Also up the block from me is Coming Soon New York; one of my top resources for housewarming gifts and discovering new artists. The shop’s owners, Helena and Fabiana, have a fantastic eye for curation and have put together what I think is the best assortment of interior goods in the city. The owners work directly with the artists and designers they stock in the store, which adds to the personalized feel of the Coming Soon experience. They’ve also built out a pop-up space in the basement (which you can access from the street) - it’s currently home to an LA-based design studio and community center called Otherwild. They also have a fun series called Tiger Homes, which is a Chinese horoscope project that documents their collectors in their homes.  @comingsoonny @otherwild

## Little Chair
Little Chair, which is located right under the Brooklyn bridge, is the newest addition to the 138 Division family (who also started and operates neighborhood mainstays like Forgetmenot and Kiki’s). This group partners with their staff on opening new spots - You can find the owners actually working at each location, ensuring every place maintains its soul and integrity. I’ve always appreciated how protective they are of our neighborhood’s individual character; they always make sure that everyone who’s a regular is taken care of. I can walk into these places alone at random and know I’ll be in good company, no matter the day or time. @138division

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
The businesses we visited are very important to me because the customers and shop owners have become dear friends and neighbors of mine - over the years, they have all been instrumental in providing me with a sense of community that I’m extremely grateful for.

Without independent businesses, your favorite neighborhoods’ sense of identity would collapse, the distinct culture and voice of a city would disappear, and the desire for travel would be lost. Independent businesses play a large, if underappreciated role in keeping us human.
