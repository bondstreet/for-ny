## Shigure
Shigure is a Japanese izakaya/sake bar tucked away on Church Street. It's the place I rely on for comfort food, a taste of home, and a warm welcome. The people who work there are like a family who want to keep extending that feeling to their customers. It's a localsâ€™ joint and you wind up making friends there because you already have a love for Shigure in common. It just feels good to eat there and the karaage (fried chicken) is the best in the city.

## Ten Bells
Ten Bells is a wine bar in the Lower East Side. In the midst of all these fast-moving food and wine trends, they've evolved organically and stick to what they do best. It's a cozy place with an easy vibe and, as a fan of natural wines, it's a place of constant discovery. They continue to introduce interesting wines from small producers around the world, so, by supporting Ten Bells I know i'm also giving a high five to some other independent businesses out there who are making some tasty wine.

## Burrow
For my birthday one year I received a butter cookie that was a depiction of my face. I was so impressed by how accurate and beautiful the details were (mostly crafted with icing). This bakery treats everything like a piece of art that has its own soul. On top of everything looking so great, whatever you order here is guaranteed to taste delicious!

## Bonus: Little Sevi
When my brother and sister-in-law had their daughter Sevi, they were inspired to start an online site that sells and gives exposure to
Japanese baby style. It's a family business run with love out of their home in Menlo Park. I'm proud of them and always excited to see what else they've discovered. They're about to launch a made in Japan kids denim collection. Stay tuned...

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
New ideas are born and spread from individuals, so it's nice to support these businesses and concepts that are fully infused with their values. Supporting independent businesses fosters creativity and it shows we are invested in our communities and their futures.
