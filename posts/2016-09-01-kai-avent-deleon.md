## Sincerely, Tommy
I guess the answer behind this one is a little obvious - Sincerely, Tommy is my business! More importantly, this space is my canvas. It’s the medium by which I’m able to continually tell my story...you can tell what I’m probably going through by the way everything changes and shifts in here. So, in a lot of ways, this is how I channel and articulate a lot of the mental or spiritual things I’ve been experiencing. 

I love finding new designers and seeing how pieces from them interact with each other on the racks. I love the people who I meet here - whether it’s my team (who always puts me onto stuff I’ve never heard about) or regular customers or complete strangers who just wander in. Sincerely, Tommy has provided me with this venue to learn more about people’s stories and what inspires them. So, as much as it is a business and a canvas, this place is also my number one hangout spot. It’s allowed me to spend my time doing something that’s way more than a job - none of this ever feels like work and I’m so fortunate to be able to chase what I’m passionate about every day. 

## Lovers Rock
My second spot would definitely have to be Lovers Rock. The owners, Alex and Shane, are really amazing people. It’s one of the few places in Bed Stuy that has a younger crowd but maintains this old school vibe. The soundtrack at Lovers Rock is a perpetual mix of reggae, 90s hip hop, r&b, and sometimes house - so, you know, that pretty much covers all the bases. There’s an awesome backyard you can smoke in, which is always a tremendous added bonus to any venue in New York. It’s just one of those places that can keep everyone drinking and dancing forever. Yeah - the vibe is perfect whether you’re trying to chill or have a completely wild night. Oh, and it’s also a block away from my house, so no complaints about that! 

## Calaca
My third spot is Calaca. I love this place. Like Lovers Rock, it’s really close to Sincerely, Tommy and my house. The owner is great; she’s my age and from Mexico. The really rad thing is that her mom does all the cooking and the kitchen is set up so they can maintain the original flavors she grew up with. So, what you ultimately get here is really traditional, excellent, what-you’d-eat-at-your-grandmother’s-house style Mexican food. She specializes in mezcal, too, so you can go there and try mezcal combinations that you definitely won’t find elsewhere in the city. The decor is great, the energy is awesome...Calaca is just another perfect example of an essential local spot. Simple as that.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
We work our asses off, man! Support me working my ass off! No, but honestly, there’s a lot of heart and soul that goes into starting and maintaining an independent business. You’re looking at endeavors that people commit to while knowing that these probably won’t generate a ton of income or return for them straight off the bat. You have to be all in while facing the fact that there are no guarantees down this path. 

What I really love about strong independent businesses is how you can understand their owners’ stories by stepping into their spaces or experiencing what they make and do. And it’s not just about them as individuals, but you also get a sense for what the community around that business stands for. Each of the businesses I chose tells its own distinct story...they make it really easy for you to just submerge yourself and get lost in these spaces. They’re also very New Bed Stuy while respecting the heritage of the neighborhood...none of them just happen to be here - starting them in this community was a very intentional decision on all of our parts, and it’s important that new local businesses help push things forward while staying true to what came before us.
