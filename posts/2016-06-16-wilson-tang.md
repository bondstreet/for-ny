## Jung’s Jerky

Jung’s has been around forever - it’s a long-standing, old school Chinatown business. I’ve known the second-generation owner, John, for years. He lives in the building above the store and makes jerky using a family recipe that his mother came up with. In a way, Jung’s family-owned legacy reminds me of Nom Wah’s. On top of that, the product is just great. It’s made fresh daily in small batches - Jung’s was basically artisanal before artisanal became a thing. We just rotated it out, but for over a year we used his beef jerky at Fung Tu - we’d pair it with roasted peanuts as a bar snack. That was a big hit with everyone.

## Wing Wong Bakery

Wing Wong Bakery’s been around for more than fifteen years. I remember it vividly because it’s right by my parents’ building on Allen, right around the corner. So Wing Wong was where I’d go every morning to pick up pastries and coffee. Nothing’s changed - it’s basically looked the same for the past two decades. I used to have a bakery back in 2005, so during those days I’d swing by Wing Wong to pick up tips about baking, how to make food last longer, how to brew coffee right - all of those are great memories that I hold onto.

## Fong On

Fong On is a family business that’s been here since the early 1900s. The current, second-generation owner, David, inherited the operation from his dad. The place we stopped by is their factory on Division, but they also have a retail location on Mott between Bayard and Pell - they own the whole building. We use a variety of David’s products at both Nom Wah and Fung Tu. For Fong Tu, we use the actual ho fun (rice noodle) in our stir fry mixed in with locally sourced chorizo and bean sprouts. At Nom Wah we use their liquid rice for chow fun. I’ve been going to all three of these places since I was a kid, so to be able to support them as an adult really brings everything full circle.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I think independent businesses are the lifeline of every community. For example: Chinese food. New York City is a distribution hub for all Chinese restaurants along the eastern seaboard. There are literally thousands of shipping routes extending from New York that stretch up to Maine and go all the way down to Florida. Everyone relies on that supply chain, so in a sense it’s these independent purveyors that are responsible for keeping countless restaurants across the country operational. Additionally, I support businesses like Fong On and Jung’s because they’re making food in a way that’s disappearing from our collective memory. Once these businesses fade out, the craft goes with them. So supporting these businesses is essentially an act of preserving our culture.
