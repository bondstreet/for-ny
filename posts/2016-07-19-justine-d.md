## Mociun
I'm pretty obsessed with this store. The housewares and ceramics are perfectly curated and their jewelry is unique and breathtaking. The turquoise-adorned pieces are my favorite because they somehow don't scream SOUTHWEST HIPPY; they're refined and show restraint. At times I wish I had known about Mociun while I was picking out my engagement ring a few years back. Oh well…

Mociun doesn't feel like a New York store to me, meaning it isn't dark or cluttered; rather, it’s housed in this bright, airy, and beautifully sparse space. It’s very reminiscent of L.A.’s positive qualities, which makes Mociun my little escape from New York right in the heart of Williamsburg.

## Generation Records
I started shopping here right when it opened in (I think) 1992 or 1993. During the 90’s, there were more than a few records stores to hit for underground music throughout the West Village: Bleecker Bob’s, Second Coming Records, Rebel Rebel, Record Runner, and Generation Records. Generation is the only record store still standing in that neighborhood. How sad is that? I purchased a lot of my cassette tapes and bootleg VHS tapes of Joy Division here. To this day, their curation focuses heavily on punk, alternative, and rock - all of my favorites!

## Purl
This is hands down one of my favorite stores in the city. Purl is unlike all other yarn stores, which can be a little too "grandma" (no disrespect) or "craftsy” - this store is a much more considered experience. The yarn they carry is luxurious, the thoughtfulness and artistry of their displays is picture perfect, and the tasteful projects they come up with on www.purlbee.com (their blog) have become staples in my sewing and knitting repertoire.
I learned to knit 12 years ago and quickly became a regular at Purl. Once I began to sew, I started taking quilting classes at their former Sullivan Street location and, when I was pregnant, I shopped at Purl every single day during my last two trimesters. You can always go in and ask for help with a project you're working on. The staff are all smiles and ready to share their knowledge, which is something I really appreciate. I love to learn from my mistakes. Also, did I mention they stock a pretty comprehensive selection of Liberty of London fabrics? Dreamy...

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
The New York of today is not the New York I grew up with. I do think New York has improved immensely in most ways, but we have to be better about preserving long-standing and new businesses that are independently owned. These companies, stores, restaurants, and so on all give New York its distinctive edge. Without them, New York would have no unique point of view. Soho’s already falling prey to this as big retailers continue to flood that neighborhood. Can you imagine West Broadway turning into a suburban strip mall lined with Dunkin Donuts, Subways, and KFCs? I might cry if that happened.
