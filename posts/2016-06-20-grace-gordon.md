## Saved Tattoo

I found Saved because I followed Tamara Santiba√±ez there from her last tattoo shop. The first time she tattooed me, I knew I'd found 'The One' and wouldn't need to be tattooed by anyone else again. Being tattooed by a woman (particularly one whose style and overall creative ethos I admire) has a totally distinct energy to it; Tamara isn't the only talented woman in residency at Saved, and the female presence there gives the shop its unique vibe. After 10 or so years of non-committal ink dabbling across cities, states, and continents, I found my endgame in TS and Saved.

## St. Anselm

St. Anselm is the first restaurant I took my dad to when he visited me for the first time in NY; he's a chill old Australian dude with a refined palate for steak, orange juice and the Grateful Dead.

Needless to say, he loved this place because it is arguably the dopest, most flavorful steak (especially at this price tag) in BK. Since receiving dad's inaugural blessing, St. Anselm has become my de facto celebration meal spot. It doesn't hurt that every time I swing through there's a bunch of badass ladies in the kitchen running shit with nary a Gordon Ramsey looking alpha chef fuccboi in sight.

## Veggies Natural Juice Bar

I moved to Franklin Ave in February 2015 and Veggies quickly became one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. While it fucking sucks and I loathe being a part of it, this is a rare instance where gentrification manifests positive results for the community. Veggies simultaneously offers organic produce at accessible prices alongside the opportunity to support local, black-owned businesses. This spot uplifts you both emotionally (with the vibey A-Frame mantras I often share on my Snapchat) and physically (via vegan patties, bomb green juice, and friendly people). It's on Seamless too, so def hit the 'Blood Regenerator' if you're hungover in Crown Heights and need a lifeline.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Local businesses are run by local humans. Whenever I can, I'd rather support my neighbors, friends, peers, or people i look up to and am inspired by over a faceless corporation. Shout out to all the local humans - you know who you are!
