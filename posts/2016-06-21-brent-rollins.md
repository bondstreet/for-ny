## Mast Books

Even though it’s becoming increasingly difficult to stay open, there are still a lot of great bookstores in the city. The Strand is an iconic example, but the selection there is sort of overwhelming. When you want to focus in on a perfectly curated collection of books, Mast is unbeatable. I almost hate walking by there because it’s guaranteed that something I didn’t even know I wanted (and is probably super expensive) will catch my eye. To be honest, the experience messes with my head a little because I’d like to think that I’m an individual, but whenever I’m at Mast it’s like, “wow, everything these guys put on the shelf is a book that I like. Maybe my tastes aren’t as unique as I thought.” And that’s before you even get to their rare books cabinet, which is just as ridiculous as it gets.

## Fatoosh

Fatoosh is a small Middle Eastern falafel and pizza joint. I’ve been in this neighborhood for about two decades and I’ve been a regular at Fatoosh for 19 of those years - these guys introduced me to the concept of Middle Eastern pizza with the spiced lamb and all that. They bake their own bread in-house, too, which is awesome. My order is their fish sandwich - for $7 there’s no way you can beat it (I also haven’t seen another Middle Eastern spot in the neighborhood that has one). They also keep the tabbouleh, ful, and falafel in a glass refrigerator up front so you can pick what you want...Fatoosh is just simple, man. Perfect in its simplicity.

## Court Street Bagels

So if I’ve been going to Fatoosh for 19 out of the 20 years I’ve lived in the neighborhood, I’ve definitely been going to Court Street for all 20. The owner is an old school Brooklyn cat who, for whatever reason, strikes me as a Yankees fan. I’ve always felt that he’s doing a service for the community more than running a business, per se. He knows all of his customers by name, including me, and his staff is always comprised of young people in their first jobs. There are a bunch of other bagel spots that have opened up in the neighborhood, but Court Street is the one I’ve always been able to count on. My order is a veggie egg white omelette on a roll with cheese - I feel like I order it enough that they should have named it after me by this point. It hasn’t happened yet, but I’m still holding out for the Brentfast Sandwich. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

One of the reasons that I left California twenty years ago and moved to New York was because I disliked how many chain stores there were all over LA. I understand that there a lot of geographical and socioeconomic reasons that account for why it’s like that, but I really appreciated coming to New York and having individual, one-on-one experiences with business owners...I value how human that experience is immensely. It’s painfully apparent how that’s starting to fade away now, and I hope all of us who live in New York continue to support the businesses that provide you with the experiences you’d never get elsewhere.
