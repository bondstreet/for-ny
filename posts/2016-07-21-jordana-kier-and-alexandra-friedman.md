## Zabar's
As native Upper West Siders, we both grew up eating Zabar’s every week: bagels, lox, cheese, coffee, olives, breads, everything delicious. Living in a densely populated residential neighborhood in a busy city, we of course had access to a lot of other food markets, but Zabar’s has always had a special place in our hearts given the deep Upper West Side roots - the fact that it has been family-owned and operated since founding (by other native UWS-ers!), and our moms’ regular visits to bring us the best of the best on Sunday mornings. When our friends from out of town visit and want an authentic New York bagel, Zabar’s is at the top of the list.

## Cafe Grumpy
Cafe Grumpy is the antithesis to a big coffeeshop chain, which is exactly why we love it! Stepping into Grumpy is like putting our lives on pause for a brief moment, which rarely happens these days. Grumpy doesn’t allow laptops and has a bunch of newspapers available for its patrons. The baristas know our names and our drink of choice, and there’s always a delicious pastry selection behind the counter. Here, we’re able to take a deep breath, enjoy a great cup of coffee, and disconnect from our digital lives, which is a real luxury. Grumpy truly reminds us to stop and smell the… you know.

## The Sill
The Sill holds a special place in our hearts because it made us both “plant people.” Neither of us had ever had a plant on our desk before, and then suddenly we had the option to get THE most adorable plants delivered to us in the cutest pots ever (bright and festive, yet simple). The Sill lends a country vibe to city living and enabled us to have a connection to the outdoors even when we’re stuck in our office all week. Every plant is potted and designed with love - it’s not the kind of individualized attention that you can get from a big corporation. We’re also huge fans of The Sill’s founder, Eliza Blank, who gets her hands dirty every day in her greenhouse and manages a large, passionate, and diverse team of plant-lovers who adore working for her.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
There are so many reasons! Independent businesses bring unique character and authenticity to communities, which is particularly important in a city of skyscrapers and over 8 million people like New York City. They are also critical for sustaining local economies, recycling larger shares of their revenue back into their community, creating more jobs, and strengthening communities' social and economic relationships. For us, we'd prefer to shop local because it gives us peace of mind knowing that we're supporting other entrepreneurs and giving back to the same members of the community who have supported us. The passion of these businesses and their owners help drive our economy forward, and it's very important that we continue to support them.
