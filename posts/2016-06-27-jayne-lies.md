## Sammy’s Photo Lab

I go to Sammy's Photo Lab on a regular basis to develop my photos. I love that they have been in the same spot for 18+ years. All the signage, display photos, neon, and decor is firmly rooted the 80s / 90s. I tried to convince them to sell me the Fujifilm price board, but of course he wouldn't. On top of how much of a time warp and enigma it is, Sammy’s has the best pricing (as far as I’m concerned) with a one-hour turnaround policy. Did I mention he takes the best passport photos, too?!

## Magic Jewelry

Magic Jewelry in Chinatown is important because it's a place of pure energy. I am mesmerized by their aura-reading process - it’s incredible that all of this captured energy can be translated into colours on a printed image. That blows my mind. The fact that they have been running this business for 20 years and have accumulated so much knowledge about crystals, energy and reading is insane to me - I really do respect how magical the experience is.

## Cafe Himalaya

I have a deep respect for and attachment to Tibetan culture, people, and food ever since I backpacked to the border of Tibet and China by myself in 2007. On that trip, I was able to spend two weeks in a Tibetan temple and village on a sacred mountain. I always find myself seeking out Tibetan food in the city ‘cause I miss that experience so much! Cafe Himalaya is a condensed, mini version of that memory for me. Despite its surroundings, it’s a very zen place, my local hideout, and probably the only Tibetan restaurant in downtown NYC! 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I love places with deep history, authentic cultural flavor, and rich stories behind everything they do. When I walk into places like the ones we visited, I can immediately feel that they've stood firmly against the test of time - that they’ve fought to survive in these streets. It's not easy to stay independent and run a business in New York; you really need to be about your expertise and maintain your own flavor. Also, running an independent business is all about doing it for the community around you and representing where you are from. I really respect that.
