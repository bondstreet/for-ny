## Kichin
Having grown up in Hawaii, I always think about the huge variety of multicultural quick bite options that is so readily accessible there (aside from the usual fare like burgers and pizza). It’s interesting to observe what translates here, too: while certain things like the Hawaiian poké craze have decidedly hit the mainland, Korean "fast food" - which is also ubiquitous back home - is still fairly uncommon in NYC. 

The simplicity and quality of Kichin's ingredients and service reminds me of my favorite local joints back home. The owners and staff, who are brothers and childhood friends, immediately welcome you into their family as soon as you walk in. It’s a really nice feeling to be able to shoot the shit in their open kitchen while they prepare your meal. My fave is their fried chicken.

## Williamsburg Garment Company 
It's been very interesting to watch and learn from my friend, Maurice Malone, the one man operation behind this 4-year-old brand. He recently opened a small brick-and-mortar shop in a space that he originally intended to use as an office. The simple storefront now supports his brand’s online and wholesale success. As one of the few key designers who defined hip hop fashion in the 90s, Maurice has experienced everything the industry can throw at someone - from being a CFDA nominee to dressing the likes of Aaliyah and Eminem. I appreciate that, in his second act, he's taken it back to basics and started a homegrown business all over again. His will and passion are very inspiring.

## Studio 189 
In this time of fast fashion and mass trends, it's refreshing (and important, for that matter) to see some designers consider the ethics, message, and sustainability in both their practices and brand development. When I first met Abrima Erwiah and Rosario Dawson (the duo behind Studio 189), I was immediately drawn to their project as I am also involved in an organization called 14+ Foundation, which builds schools and promotes education in Africa. Since that first meeting, we've all been able to work with and support each other. In a way, we're building a community across different groups and industries but have a shared vision of ethical betterment for the world. The ladies recently designed the uniforms for the foundation’s schools, bringing everything full circle in a nice way. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
To me, "independent" is the key and operative word here. When you're an independent business, that generally means you have more freedom and creativity at your disposal. These are two very important qualities for brand building: along with the freedom and creativity to generate products and services that push the envelope, you’re also afforded the freedom to mess up and creatively problem solve. You get to take chances that boards or investors or shareholders wouldn’t allow you to take. So, by virtue of this, independent businesses tend to be more interesting. 

Also, as an independent business owner, you’re usually in direct contact with your customer and end user all the time. During the early stages of your business’ development, that communication really plays a key role in shaping the culture of your brand. Conversely, as a supporter of independent businesses, you are actually contributing and helping that company better serve your needs and give you more of what you want.
