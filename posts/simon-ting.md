## Flushing Supermarkets

I can’t name one in particular, but Flushing is where my family and I do most of our grocery shopping. A lot of produce and fish, most of the time. You can buy everything that reminds you of home here, and find things or ingredients that you can’t get anywhere else in the city. It’s always healthier and a good thing to cook at home if you can.

## Congee Village

Congee Village serves very authentic Chinese food, which is healthier than P.F. Chang’s and cheaper than Panda Express. Everything on their menu is great. Most Chinese restaurants in the city are down in Chinatown, but Congee Village is on the Bowery. They get the flavors right - it’s not so much like American Chinese food where everything is covered in really strong sauces and MSG. Very healthy. I like a lot of the chicken dishes.

## New York Fashion Brands

A lot of fashion brands in the city come to us to production because we keep things simple and work hard. Suno, Public School - several others. Many of them find out about us through my son or my daughter-in-law. A lot of their friends have projects or need to cut a pattern a certain way, so we are happy to help them with that. Some of them are like family at this point.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

A lot of the people who work here are from all over China. Some are from other countries, but everyone is an immigrant - it was really difficult for many of them to make their way to America. It’s a really hard journey, but people do it because they know they can achieve their dreams here. We worked hard to make sure that everyone has proper documentation and green cards. Like how my family grew when we settled down in New York, we want to make sure our employees can grow their families in America. You can grow your family here and start a business - that’s very challenging to do in a lot of places that people come from.
