## Peppa’s

Peppa’s is close to me because it’s pretty much my idea of what a perfect West Indian restaurant is. There’s no seating, which I like - no lighting, which I also like - it’s open 24 hours a day and no one ever smiles at you. Most importantly, the food is legitimately the best. It’s never anything less than amazing - no one I’ve taken to Peppa’s has left disappointed. The thing is, I didn’t even know about Peppa’s until I was in college because I went to high school on the Upper East Side with a bunch of white and Asian kids. So, for a while, I was disconnected from the kids who grew up in the neighborhood I was actually from. It was kind of like this double life. I went to St. John’s for college, though, so at that point I found myself back in this predominantly West Indian, first generation group of kids who’d grown up where I did. Through them, I started being able to catch up on all this stuff I’d missed in high school. After parties, we’d get in the car (no one ever took cabs, everybody drove) and my boys would drive us home. On the way, we’d stop at Peppa’s, get a five dollar plate, crush that, go to bed. From that point on, anyone who visits me in New York and wants good West Indian food? We go straight to Peppa’s.

## Allan’s Bakery

Allan’s is a really famous Haitian bakery on Nostrand that’s been around since I was a kid. It’s on a strip of Nostrand that’s full of West Indian businesses. Allan’s is where we got patties for literally every single milestone event that I attended since I was a child. There’s a competitor on the street that some people use, but no one in my circle fucks with them. It’s funny because, like Peppa’s, I never stepped into Allan’s until I was an adult. But in this case it’s because, as a kid, I’d always have to wait in the car. Nowadays, they cover the whole West Indian spectrum, but when I was little it was always known as a very Haitian spot. 

## Fine Line Tattoos

Fine Line is owned by a guy named Mehai Bakaty, who inherited the shop when his father passed away two years ago. I’ve been going to Fine Line since 2008. I have ten tattoos; Mehai’s done six of them. I met Mehai because my friend got this really beautiful Le Petit Prince from him. Up until then, all my tattoos had been pretty random - I decided I really wanted an artist who I could call and discuss ideas with going forward. So my friend introduced me to Mehai and...the first time I met him, he convinced me to change the location and size of my design. If you know me, anyone who can make me change my mind about anything is someone I trust for sure. Now we’re at the point where I’ll just text him and be like, “hey! I saw this thing in a book,” and he’ll work through the concept with me. Another great thing about Fine Line is that it’s right by where East Village Radio was. I’d go by on Friday nights when the Fader was doing the Let Out and get a tattoo during the middle of the show. Later on, I found out that Fine Line was the same spot Amy Winehouse was getting tattooed at when she did her Fader interview. Pretty crazy.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

My grandfather was an independent business owner- he owned and operated a printing press in Jackson Heights. I’d spend all my weekends there. I just remember being super proud that my grandfather owned his business and looking up to the rapport he had with each of his customers. I’m one of those kids who grew up obsessed with how characters on TV and in movies could call up their Chinese spot and the guy would immediately know their regular orders. So my grandfather having that same connection with his customers was super inspiring to me. That’s the beautiful thing about independent businesses - they know your family, they know your friends...the familiarity there really elevates those businesses beyond final transactions, you know? It becomes something way more essential to the community.
