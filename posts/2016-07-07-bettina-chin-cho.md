## Norman and Jules
Brooklyn, especially where I live in Park Slope, is chock-full of amazing independent shops that cater to families. As a new mother, I’m always excited to explore them all. Norman and Jules is my go-to kid's shop.  There, I've discovered Naoko Stoop's artwork, charming customizable lightboxes by A Little Lovely Company, beautiful sustainable wooden toys, building sets that make perfect gifts, and - my favorite - mushroom lamps to transform my son's room into a woodland fantasy. This shop's product and brand assortment is so on point: I can't walk in without walking out with goodies for my son or presents for my friends' kids!

## Purl Soho
I picked up crocheting when I was pregnant (thanks to nesting hormones and the wonders of YouTube) and discovered the ultimate mecca for yarn porn at Purl Soho. Just looking at their walls of perfectly color-coordinated yarn is extremely satisfying! They have great starter kits and classes for beginners to crafting (i.e., for knitting/crocheting, quilting, sewing, etc.), and their selection of materials is lovely.  Because of Purl, I was able to make some pieces that are destined to one day become family heirlooms.

## Mission Chinese
Food has always ranked extremely high on my list of loves, and Mission Chinese is one of my favorite restaurants in New York. For me, a good restaurant not only has consistently excellent food - it also has to be the right kind of environment for close friends to catch up, family members to have a good time, and lovers to rekindle their passion for one another. Mission Chinese is all of that for me!

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
There's something truly magical about independent businesses that simply cannot be replicated in the big-box, corporate space. I really value how regular consumers like me can easily foster real, personal relationships with independent businesses - this is what makes them cornerstones of the neighborhoods they’re in. Take my local coffee shop, for example (Blue Sky on 5th Avenue in Park Slope). Yes, their private label coffee and housemade muffins are absolutely, incontestably delicious (you can't get these flavors and this kind of quality from a megastore brand), but what makes this place such a local favorite is the staff: they take such excellent care of me every morning when I pop in on my way to work for my to-go cup. They take the time the time to greet the customers and chat about what's going on in their lives. It's the best way for anyone to start a morning, really.
