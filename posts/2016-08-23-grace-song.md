## Paula Rubenstein
Paula Rubenstein is on… I want to say Bond right off of Lafayette, but they used to be on Prince next to that leather goods store, Ghurka. She’s so cool...the store has always had the craziest curation of antiques, from old blankets to vintage fabric swatches that I’m sure fashion people come in to source and replicate all the time. Then you’ll find like, random surgical tools or hardware...just anything imaginable. But the thing is, again, her curation is so careful and unique. The edit is so solid that you know you’ll never find anything that’s garbage in there. Paula is always in the store and will show you the craziest things that you can’t even see on their already-packed floor. 

## 45 RPM
45 RPM is on Mercer. It’s just absolutely nuts and so few people seem to know about it. That store is one of the most insane tactile experiences in the city. They weave their own fabrics and hand sew them into the craziest, most fucked up pieces...then I think they must like, wash each piece a hundred times or something. Everything looks like a relic - so cool. It’s such an underrated spot. Part of why I love 45 RPM so much is that it’s such a secret hidden in plain sight. Mercer’s a busy street! The whole scent that fills that space up, plus the dim gallery lighting combined with the insane hospitality makes the store that much weirder of an experience. Any detail you look at in there is going to be on some other shit - the flooring, the buttons on the counter...it’s all so different from anything you’d expect or be used to. It’s so well thought out. 

## Wu Lim Services
Wu Lim is a massage spot on Grand. You walk down the staircase into this basement and there’s this room with like 20-25 massage tables. Just out in the open. There aren’t any screens or partitions for you to change behind, so you don’t get undressed. Or you do get undressed. I’ve done it. ...Depending on what I’m wearing. (Laughs) And yeah...it’s like $34 for like 46 minutes, something weirdly specific like that. They just go. At. You. They’re all crazy strong. My advice is to start on your stomach because they’ll put paper towels around the face ring, so if you END face down...when you walk out into the daylight you’re doing that with crazy paper towel marks in your face. I’d tell you who my favorite person is, but I can’t really be sharing her, so, sorry. They’re the best. And if you don’t believe me, John, our showroom manager, walked in and he said Adrian Brody was in there. And you know you can trust Adrian Brody.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
When you’re dealing with a small, independent business - you know that the people who work there care more. I’ve been in the inner workings of an independent business for 11 years with BDDW...I’ve done everything from fix the toilets to fulfill payroll. So I know how much other people who run their own companies go through on a day to day basis, right? I know what the entire spectrum of tasks and concerns they have to juggle looks and feels like. So for me, it’s all about realizing that independent business owners are forced to care more because this is their life...it’s much more than just a job. 

That understanding makes it so that you build (and get to be part of) a really great community where people are always helping each other out. I lean on my friends who are business owners for their expertise all the time. If you need advice on financing or a reliable wall painter, we share resources and people always look out. We’re lucky to have our showrooms here on Crosby, where there is such a deep-rooted group of businesses that support each other, and in Milan, as well. We couldn’t do what we do without our neighbors and friends.
