## Duals Specialty
Duals Specialty represents visual overload at its best. I can spend hours on hours poking around in this East Village spice shop on the cusp of Indian Row. Everything about it is so stimulating and inspiring. They carry pretty much all things herbal and spice-related: from lava salt to holy basil. I love how meticulously organized and arranged everything is, as well - it's like they’ve established the Dewey decimal system for foodies. 

## Maryam Nassir Zadeh 
The second business on my list is Maryam Nassir Zadeh. It's beyond impossible to not want  absolutely everything in Maryam's namesake store. Between the impeccable, diverse color palettes and the perfectly curated collections she houses at any given time, I always identify Maryam’s sensibilities as the benchmark, the standard for identifying what it means to feel and look like the timeless modern woman.

## Coming Soon New York
I can always be sure that I’ll encounter something unique whenever I walk into this kooky home goods boutique. It’s right up the block from us on Orchard Street - you can’t miss it - they’re rotating the brilliant look and feel of the store all the time. The incredibly endearing and friendly owners of Coming Soon, Helena and Fabiana, always have something new to show and discuss with you. Best in class, however is their permanent, on-site meditation cocoon; absolutely crucial for that 2 (or 10) minute escape during the day. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Independent businesses are where most interesting concepts and new ideas are generated. To run an independent business is to chance everything, so you can be assured that most people behind these operations are risk takers who are willing to push the envelope. There’s a vibrant energy around that process that inevitably inspires those peeking in. This, to me, is the pulse that draws people in to New York; it’s what makes our city so compelling and exciting. Without independent businesses, we would just be another cookie cutter town that lacks any real vision or spirit.
