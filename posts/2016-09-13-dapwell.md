## Nelly's
My neighbor George tells the story of a neighborhood tough guy who used to walk down the block in the early eighties and steal anything that wasn't bolted down: people's groceries, cars, mail, whatever. One day George's friend was helping him fix the railing on his stairs when the dude walks by and grabs some shit out of his boy’s toolbox and slickly walks on by. Without missing a beat, George's friend runs up behind him and bops him on the head with the wrench he already had in his hand. The dude just laid there for half an hour before getting up and stumbling away. That story has nothing to do with Nelly's Flower Shop, an oddly triangle-shaped but beautiful greenhouse oasis that's basically underneath the Lorimer J train in South Williamsburg. They do all sorts of flower arrangements for holidays, funerals, and apologizing for being a dick to your spouse stuff but I think the real gem is the wide selection of live plants and trees in this place. I bought a highly fragrant Meyer lemon tree here that's still regularly dropping citrus that I let get wrinkly and gross in a basket. This place has been open here since 1971, lord knows the kind of crazy hijinx they've witnessed over the years (being located directly adjacent to the 90th precinct probably helps though.)

## To The World Farm 
This Korean-run produce and grocery store has been running for more than 20 years on Grand Street in Williamsburg. It's located next to an Associated supermarket whose paltry produce selections pale in comparison. The owner and the staff are unbelievably nice and helpful. They're also all very good-looking. I've been wanting for years to ask f they're related but I'm afraid of sounding racist. A solid selection produce, cheap and fresh herbs, along with tofu and homemade kimchi makes this spot worth a visit. They started juicing not too long ago, and they have the biggest and cheapest wheatgrass shot in town. If you're a regular they also let you run a tab! A TAB! Try that at a supermarket!

## Spoonbill & Sugartown, Booksellers 
The second outpost of this Williamsburg institution (the original branch on Bedford Avenue opened in 1999, making it an institution in this neighborhood) opened on the ground floor of my building. The selection is immaculate and well thought-out and the way the store is laid out makes it a real haven for smartypants, eccentrics, perverts, and regulars. My man Jonas is also pretty cool about doing events in there, I'll be sure to have my short story collection release gala there as soon as possible, folks. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I'm from Queens, but I've lived on this one block, more on than off, for ten years. I lived on the other side of the block ten years ago. I used to be able to see the room I was being an idiot in when I was 22 from my kitchen window until a year ago when the building was predictably demolished to make way for a hideous condo.  This neighborhood is increasingly swarming with transient, transplant garbage from the rest of America who want to change their parts of the neighborhood before they even get to know it. Many refuse to integratt or interact with local businesses and people. Or they use their cash reserves to force their own uninspired and played-out boutiques, bars, and coffee shops onto the streetscape. 

The Southside, through strong community organizations, has been able to resist the level of onslaught seen in the neighborhood's Northside. At a recent community board meeting I heard the lawyer of a yet-to-open coffeeshop (the 4th in a 3 block vicinity!) vying for a liquor license threaten to override the church across the street and the community's resistance to their 4 AM closing time by appealing directly to the state liquor board in Harlem. They claimed to be opening a "neighborhood gathering spot" too. Whose neighborhood? Definitely not the one saying they don't want another bar for white kids from the Midwest to be boring in. 

Diverse, independent small businesses give the city it's unique and (disappearing) character. The more corporate and outside forces make it untenable for people from the city to keep themselves and their business here, the less worthwhile and interesting a city to live in this becomes. Support your local businesses and participate in local politics. at the very least throw rocks through glass condominium windows at night. If not, we can watch all the great things about the city's neighborhoods get up and stumble away like so many toolbox thieves in the night.
