## Duke’s Liquor Box
I have a sort of bingey personality--- I get fixated on a song or a project or a flavor and I tend to just live there until my attention is redirected. My future wife has learned to tolerate the fact that I will play a song on repeat for an entire afternoon until I have a chance to fully wring out of it whatever I was hoping there was to wring. Or that I will cook the same cut of steak every night for two weeks straight until it tastes the way I imagined it would taste in my head. 

Bartending for me is similar in the sense that it was always an exercise trying to achieve a combination of flavors and textures that were perfectly realized in my imagination but didn’t exist as a recipe yet.

Step in to Duke’s Liquor Box.

Patrick, the proprietor of Duke’s, stocks a shop of filled with bottles of booze you’ve likely never heard of. Local stuff and foreign stuff, the folks who work here are mostly seasoned bartenders, really know their spirits and are real cocktail geeks. They host a few tasting events per week with the actual distillers (they are healthily-portioned tastings if that matters...) which is a great way for local folks to get educated. A few years back I had an idea for a cocktail I wanted to call the “Come, Come Mister Bond---” I knew that it was to taste of “Alpine” without knowing what that actually was. A trip to Duke’s and I was set with a Pine liqueur I never knew existed. Patrick also spends a lot of time out in front of the store with his son (and the shop’s namesake) Duke, and as such knows just about everyone and everything that’s happening in the community.

## Tar Pit Cafe
Summer of 2011 I was working at a motorcycle repair show right off McCarren park in Williamsburg and my boss was Kerry Sano-- Moto rider, trained NASCAR mechanic and owner of the recently opened Tar Pit Cafe. In addition to the beautiful Kyoto-style Cold Brew rig she built, Kerry also managed to turn 200 square feet of abandoned storefront in a lonely corner of Greenpoint into a warm and inviting spot to read the paper, get some espresso and pastry, and do some motorcycle watching.  Kerry was a big part of me becoming an entrepreneur and she and I plan to start a coffee roasting company at some point in the future. We don’t have any talent or experience but we have picked out a name….

## Archestratus Books + Foods
I met Paige, the owner of Archestratus, at a community board hearing in which our request to put a small cocktail bar in our restaurant’s garden space was unceremoniously rejected and Archestratus was approved to serve Beer & Wine as part of their Cafe service. Part bakery, part restaurant, part bookstore-- Archestratus is an incredible shop committed to cooking, its practice and its history. In addition to the usual suspects, Archestratus carries some of the quirkiest and unexpected cook books you’ll ever come across. Prior to hospitality I spent years working in publishing and bookselling and have watched bookstore after bookstore disappear. It’s refreshing to know that there are still book-people out there and that some of them are entrepreneurs like Paige. We stop in multiple times per week for her incredible pastries and sometimes a glass of wine or two.  Archestratus is also the perfect place to go when you need a gift, some inspiration or maybe just a good recipe. 

## Why is it important to support local businesses?
At home, we have a beautifully stupid and loving 6 year old dog named Tessa. Yes, we could buy her food on Amazon and save a few bucks and spare me lugging a 50 lb bag of kibble down the street. But, we like that the folks at our local pet store know Tessa by name, that they know what kind of treats she likes, and we like that she looks forward to visiting the shop as much as they look forward to seeing her. We like knowing that if we run out of food on Sunday morning they are right down the street. But they won’t continue to be here unless we commit to being their patrons.

It’s painful to watch local businesses get priced out by inflated rents and online shopping and even more painful when folks act surprised to see Mom and Pop’s go out of business. Local and independent businesses are owned and operated by real people not corporations and if we want them to stick around we need to stay involved! 

Whether as a gathering spot for strangers to bond over a mutual interest (like cooking or motorcycles or cocktails) or as a surrogate for our tiny NYC apartments, Local businesses offer much more than just products-- they provide a place in the community to engage your neighbors that non-local businesses have no authentic interest in providing. 

At the bottom of our menu are the words “Owned and Operated by Residents of Greenpoint,” a fact that was snarkily commented on by the NY Times earlier this year in yet another half-baked think piece about how New York City maybe lost its soul. Owned and Operated by Residents of Greenpoint means we’ve been here for a hot minute. We didn’t read about how Greenpoint was the next Williamsburg in a newspaper and decide to stake our claim.  We established businesses here because we have lived here for years and because we are invested in our community. We have more than 40 employees and while some of them take the train in from Manhattan, from Queens and even a few from the Bronx, the vast majority of our team walks to work. It means we live in and are at the mercy of 11222. No longer mere residents, we are proud shopkeepers in our neighborhood. We know our neighbors and they know us. If you really want to boil it down, supporting neighborhood businesses means taking measurable pride in your neighborhood itself and i don’t think anything speaks to the soul of New York City more than that.
