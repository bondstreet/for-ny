## IF Boutique
IF is owned by two sisters from Beirut, where they actually have another location of IF. They’ve lived in New York for a while - I believe the Soho location opened sometime in the late 80s. To their credit, the team behind IF was looking into buying brands like Comme des Garcons and Yohji [Yamamoto] before anyone really understood or knew too much about them. As someone who appreciates those brands and also as someone who worked at Comme des Garcons in Japan during the early days, I got to meet many of the groundbreaking store owners who were willing to take risks - I really respect the IF sisters because of that. Who, at that time, really knew what to do with those clothes? Sometimes it was even a little over the top for me! Similarly, when the Belgian designers first emerged - like Martin [Margiela] and Ann [Demeulemeester] - IF was the first to take them on. They’d always have the best, strongest pieces that big department stores would stay away from. That tradition continues to this day at IF, which is why I love going there as much as I did when they first opened.

## G&G Cleaners and Alteration
G&G has been a neighborhood mainstay since forever. As a fashion showroom, one of our constant needs is fast cleaning and alterations. As representatives of other people’s brands, we’re entrusted with holding many of their samples. If an outfit comes back from dirty from a shoot (which is something that happens all the time), you’d have to get it back into impeccable shape in short order. Angela has always been so quick at taking care of any issue imaginable, whether something needed to be altered or a strap had ripped off. Everything in our business is so ASAP, and the folks at G&G just make it happen. So, naturally, my team and I have been going there since as long as I can remember. In fact, if any customers at IF wanted alterations, or even back when Comme used to be in the neighborhood - everything would go to G&G.

On a personal level, I’m a big fan of vintage clothing, so I’d buy, say, jeans and take them to Angela for modifications because I can’t sew myself. We’d have so much fun talking through adjustments on each piece - it was almost like we were making something together! I’ve saved many of the results from those experiments and they’ve played an instrumental role in the development of my own brand, 6397. You know, sometimes we’ll be debating about what our jeans will look like and I’ll remember that I already have exactly what I want on-hand thanks to one of Angela and my projects.

## Gyrotonic Soho at Movement & Beyond
Movement has been around for almost ten years, and I’ve been going there for about five. I tried pilates and yoga, but those didn’t really do much for me, so I was very intrigued to learn more when I first heard about gyrotonics. Movement is run by women who are dancers, which is something I appreciated tremendously. I like how simple the studio is and how reasonably priced classes are, especially compared to fancier gyrotonic studios. They only take about five people per class, so although it’s technically in a group setting, you get a lot of individualized attention. Health-wise, it’s certainly helped me a lot - I think my posture and stance is straighter than it’s ever been - and mentally I feel more focused. I’ll try to stop by three nights a week after work, and at this point the hour I spend there has almost become meditative for me. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Independence is essential to our lives beyond its application and value to business. Maintaining that spirit is what allows you to explore and try new things without feeling constrained. At its core, running your own company is all about trusting yourself - that autonomy is what ultimately allows you to take great risks. Of course, you have to look at what’s happening around you and refer to the numbers as well, but a lot of decision-making comes down to following your instincts. So when you support an independent business, you’re supporting a true reflection of the person or people behind it. 

Cultivating a human connection between everyone who plays a role in a business is such a magical thing. For us, that begins with the team and extends outward to our designers and customers. Those relationships, no matter how humble, are what make this journey more important than just a series of transactions - it gets very hard to replicate that in a regimented, corporate environment.
