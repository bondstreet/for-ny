## Dripper World
J: One of the best parts of touring for me is getting to check out all the strange junk and trinkets you come across at rest stops and the random souvenir stores around the US and in other countries. It's always essentially the same stuff with slight tweaks depending on where you are - novelty pins, pressed pennies, bumper stickers, printed ephemera, etc. I always seek it out whenever we get to our destination and it's more or less become my way to explore a new city. Dripper World has a wide and well-curated collection of these kinds of items, as well as records, tapes, and merch for/by a lot of local NYC punk bands. My friend Betty first told me about the store when I noticed this really amazing earring she was wearing one night. She showed me their Instagram (@dripperworld) and I had to check out the store in person. It feels so specifically catered to my very particular interest in this kind of junk that it's almost too good to be true - it is the kind of store that I hope to run someday.

## Signal
M: The history of SIGNAL Gallery is tied inexorably with Wet’s. The summer it opened, SIGNAL became our first rehearsal space. It was also where we played our first show. And, more recently, they hosted our record release party. I think that a lot of other artists, musicians, and performers in the community share a similar relationship with Signal. It's like home base and their doors are always open. It is first and foremost an excellent and forward-thinking art gallery, run by our friends Kyle and Alex, though in practice it functions as much more than that. In its giant, primary white box space, you’re as likely to find a noise show going down as you might a book fair, a fundraiser, a party, a party that is also a fundraiser, or a painting exhibition. And, if nothing happens to be scheduled on any particular night, you can usually find Kyle and Alex hosting a campfire in the backyard with cold beers for anyone who happens to pass through.

## Sincerely, Tommy
K: I was introduced to Sincerely, Tommy and owner Kai Avent-DeLeon by our awesome stylist Jess Willis last year when we were looking for clothes for a video shoot. Since then, I've religiously followed what's going on over there and am always in awe of how cool and tasteful Kai is. I find her vision for Sincerely, Tommy inspiring. Now, whenever I need something to wear for a tour, a shoot, or just for fun, it's become my go-to place in the city. I love the clothes, the coffee, the art, the photos, and the events that they put on.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
J: To me, it's so nice and comforting to know and support the people who are serving your community. This is especially true in a city like New York where things can (and often do) feel so impersonal and ephemeral. I think it's important for everyone to have some sort of relationship with the people who provide the goods and services that keep this city running...and in the case of Dripper World, keep it vibrant. : )

M: Small businesses are woven into the fabric of our city in a way that corporations and chains simply can't (they probably have little to no interest in this, anyways). Whether it's the little pizza shop on your corner or it's the neighborhood bar, these are the institutions that bind communities together. It also goes without saying that they're usually just better than big box alternatives.

K: Kai grew up 4 blocks away from Sincerely, Tommy - her connection to Bed Stuy is reflected in the space in so many ways. It's important to support businesses that are owned and run by those who are in touch with and care about the needs of the people who live in those communities rather than huge companies that don't care or even profit from the destruction of the neighborhoods they go into.
