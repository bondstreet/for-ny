Noble Plants
I'm not sure how long Noble Plants has been around, but it's definitely been at least 20 years and it feels like even longer than that. Their selection of cactii and succulents is extensive and being inside the shop is like dropping into an actual jungle. I go a lot of times just to browse and surround myself with good vibes. The best part of Noble is the owner, who’s so connected to his plants that he’ll talk to you about them as if they're sentient beings. It almost feels like he's letting you buy one of his personal plants because he’s so meticulous about making sure that it's going to a good home (in the sense that he doesn't bullshit about what they need). He'll straight up tell you the plant will probably die in that cave you call an apartment, considering your excuse for “natural light” is the depressing shaft of sunshine that wiggles its way through two buildings into your living room for one hour a day.

Rock Star Crystals
I like Rock Star because their collection really runs the gamut from little chunks of rocks for $1 to $1500, huge crystal geodes that looks like The Wall in Game of Thrones with the wildings coming to attack it. I sometimes come here to shop when I need to satisfy my hippie inclinations; I’ll get some crystals to tune the vibes in my house properly, and other times it's just about looking at amazing structures and minerals.  

Kidding Around
So I admit it - I'm pretty much an internet shopper. It's not just because I'm busy and it’s generally more convenient, but a lot of times it's about satiating my obsession with having ALL of the choices; if a real store don’t have the widest array of options available to me I start feeling this creeping sense of FOMO. Kidding Around, however, is one of those places that is so much better than any internet shopping experience, if only because their edit of toys is so excellent that I’m willing to concede they’ve already done the work of finding the good stuff. Now that I've just had my own baby, going into this store excites me in a new way - I can’t wait for him to get older and watch him discover and play with all this stuff.

Why is it important to support independent businesses?
All three of these stores are perfect examples of why independent businesses are so important - it's all about the perspective and expertise of the owner - if those things resonate with you, that’s probably an experience you can’t beat or replicate. When I go to Noble Plants, I know I will come across something beautifully weird that I wouldn't have found otherwise because the owner has already done all the hard curatorial work. It’s the same case with both of the other businesses I chose. Of course, there’s also the fact that if we don't support independent businesses, we will soon drown in a sea of Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, and Walgreens.
