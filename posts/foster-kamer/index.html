<p>Everyone in New York&#39;s got these vectors we move through everyday. I&#39;ve always been a big coffee drinker, but until I moved to East Williamsburg seven years ago, I wasn&#39;t lucky enough to live near a great coffee shop. Since then, it&#39;s become part of that daily vector—someone else&#39;s business that&#39;s become an extension of my own life. My days feel patently off without stopping in there first. And while it happens to be one of the best coffee shops in the city, it&#39;s so much more to me—and the neighborhood—than that. I&#39;ve worked my ass off there: It&#39;s the place where I ran Gawker out of for a year on weekends early on in my career, from the moment they opened, until the moment they closed. I&#39;ve made friends there. I&#39;ve learned about things there, from the people behind the counter, my neighbors, and so on. There&#39;s not enough space here to write as effusively in praise of Variety as it deserves, so I&#39;ll just say this: Their cold brew is the shit, drinkable year-round, miss at your own peril.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Crest%20Hardware.jpg" alt="Crest Hardware"><h2 id="crest-hardware">Crest Hardware</h2>
<p>By all appearances, just another hardware store, until you get to know Harrison, the Macaw who chills in the garden center, or Franklin, the (second-generation) owner Joe Franquinha&#39;s pot-bellied pig who&#39;s posted in the backyard. It&#39;s a hardware store that hosts art shows, Halloween parties, short film festivals. It&#39;s a hardware store where people have worked for fifty years. It&#39;s a hardware store that has everything you need, and nothing you don&#39;t. It&#39;s a hardware store that doubles as a community center. It&#39;s a hardware store where you&#39;ll walk around in the backyard on a Sunday afternoon and look at plants because it&#39;s just a nice, meditative thing to do, and they&#39;re totally okay with people doing that. So yeah, it&#39;s just a hardware store, but also, a weirdly inspiring and perfect one for this neighborhood, where it&#39;s become a weirdly critical institution, and not just because they sell hammers. But yes: Hammers are also important, and this is where you go in Williamsburg to buy one.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Diner.jpg" alt="Diner"><h2 id="diner">Diner</h2>
<p>Diner&#39;s become one of the most essential restaurants in the city simply by being itself, not kowtowing to trends, not making any kind of changes as the neighborhood around it has shifted entirely. It&#39;s a fussy place—it&#39;s loud, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s built into an old dining car, most of the menu (which changes, daily) is written on butcher paper on your table, and your meal will soundtracked with anything from Leonard Cohen to Lil&#39; Wayne (possibly in the same hour). It&#39;s got one of the most romantic locales in the city, smack under the Williamsburg Bridge. But the brilliance of Diner is its out-and-out utility: You can stop in dolo for coffee and eggs, or a burger and beer. You can also get some of the most brilliantly composed dishes on that same menu at a party of a meal with friends. It&#39;s the rare place that manages to have something for everyone, and again, it&#39;s become that place by not giving a shit about what&#39;s happened around it. Anyway: If I care about you as a human being, we&#39;ve probably eaten at Diner together, or will at some point. </p><h2 id="why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to see why supporting independent businesses is substantially important to supporting what you love about a city. Just flip the proposition, right? You vote with your wallet. Is supporting chain stores and franchises backing what you love about New York? If the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; please flush yourself back to Jersey, or Rockland County, or Cleveland, or wherever. I don&#39;t know about you people, but I moved here to move to Nora Ephron&#39;s New York, DFA&#39;s New York, Spy&#39;s New York, and so much of those people&#39;s output and the New York that helped them create it revolved around the way they transacted their lives when they weren&#39;t doing that. And those people weren&#39;t going to Whole Foods, or some shitty midtown sad desk salad chain—they were going to Katz&#39;s, Diner, Elaine&#39;s, etc. When you support this city&#39;s independent businesses, you support the identity of New York as established and defined and propagated by those who live here, who want it to be better than the increasingly indistinguishable, suburban, and middlebrow lameass identity of growing cities around the country. We put up with too much shit here to not have it be better than that. Otherwise, we all might as well move to Jersey.</p></div><div class="sm-col-6 mx-auto my4" data-reactid="39"><div class="bg-green mint"

Coffee](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Variety%20Coffee.jpg)\n## Variety Coffee\nEveryone in New York's got these vectors we move through everyday. I've always been a big coffee drinker, but until I moved to East Williamsburg seven years ago, I wasn't lucky enough to live near a great coffee shop. Since then, it's become part of that daily vector—someone else's business that's become an extension of my own life. My days feel patently off without stopping in there first. And while it happens to be one of the best coffee shops in the city, it's so much more to me—and the neighborhood—than that. I've worked my ass off there: It's the place where I ran Gawker out of for a year on weekends early on in my career, from the moment they opened, until the moment they closed. I've made friends there. I've learned about things there, from the people behind the counter, my neighbors, and so on. There's not enough space here to write as effusively in praise of Variety as it deserves, so I'll just say this: Their cold brew is the shit, drinkable year-round, miss at your own peril.\n\n![Crest Hardware](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Crest%20Hardware.jpg)\n## Crest Hardware\nBy all appearances, just another hardware store, until you get to know Harrison, the Macaw who chills in the garden center, or Franklin, the (second-generation) owner Joe Franquinha's pot-bellied pig who's posted in the backyard. It's a hardware store that hosts art shows, Halloween parties, short film festivals. It's a hardware store where people have worked for fifty years. It's a hardware store that has everything you need, and nothing you don't. It's a hardware store that doubles as a community center. It's a hardware store where you'll walk around in the backyard on a Sunday afternoon and look at plants because it's just a nice, meditative thing to do, and they're totally okay with people doing that. So yeah, it's just a hardware store, but also, a weirdly inspiring and perfect one for this neighborhood, where it's become a weirdly critical institution, and not just because they sell hammers. But yes: Hammers are also important, and this is where you go in Williamsburg to buy one.\n\n![Diner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Diner.jpg)\n## Diner\nDiner's become one of the most essential restaurants in the city simply by being itself, not kowtowing to trends, not making any kind of changes as the neighborhood around it has shifted entirely. It's a fussy place—it's loud, it's fun, it's built into an old dining car, most of the menu (which changes, daily) is written on butcher paper on your table, and your meal will soundtracked with anything from Leonard Cohen to Lil' Wayne (possibly in the same hour). It's got one of the most romantic locales in the city, smack under the Williamsburg Bridge. But the brilliance of Diner is its out-and-out utility: You can stop in dolo for coffee and eggs, or a burger and beer. You can also get some of the most brilliantly composed dishes on that same menu at a party of a meal with friends. It's the rare place that manages to have something for everyone, and again, it's become that place by not giving a shit about what's happened around it. Anyway: If I care about you as a human being, we've probably eaten at Diner together, or will at some point. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIt's not hard to see why supporting independent businesses is substantially important to supporting what you love about a city. Just flip the proposition, right? You vote with your wallet. Is supporting chain stores and franchises backing what you love about New York? If the answer is \"yes,\" please flush yourself back to Jersey, or Rockland County, or Cleveland, or wherever. I don't know about you people, but I moved here to move to Nora Ephron's New York, DFA's New York, Spy's New York, and so much of those people's output and the New York that helped them create it revolved around the way they transacted their lives when they weren't doing that. And those people weren't going to Whole Foods, or some shitty midtown sad desk salad chain—they were going to Katz's, Diner, Elaine's, etc. When you support this city's independent businesses, you support the identity of New York as established and defined and propagated by those who live here, who want it to be better than the increasingly indistinguishable, suburban, and middlebrow lameass identity of growing cities around the country. We put up with too much shit here to not have it be better than that. Otherwise, we all might as well move to Jersey.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Variety%20Coffee.jpg\" alt=\"Variety Coffee\"><h2 id=\"variety-coffee\">Variety Coffee</h2>\n<p>Everyone in New York&#39;s got these vectors we move through everyday.

You can satisfy your cravings for sushi, tacos, sandwiches and delicious healthy food all in one place. The tacos and fruit pops at Pulqueria are beyond yummy. I've now tried the fish tacos and the steak tacos and I can say they are some of the best I've ever had - not just in NYC, I really mean ever! The bright color treatments on all of the shipping containers and the super cool people who work there may add to the whole experience, but damn if those tacos aren't addictive.\n\n![The Smile](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Audrey%20Gingras%20The%20Smile.jpg)\n## The Smile\nThe Smile is my favorite lunch spot in the hood. The food is always delicious here and the menu has a lot of healthy options that manage to be super satisfying. As someone with a real sweet tooth, I always appreciate that The Smile has a solid dessert selection, but I always find myself opting for the chocolate chip & sea salt cookies - I just love them so much. Carlos and Matt have done a great job of making The Smile a comfortable yet cool restaurant; it’s plain to see why it’s become the local institution that it is.  \n\n![Gasoline Alley Coffee](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Audrey%20Gingras%20Gasoline%20Alley.jpg)\n## Gasoline Alley Coffee\nThe Gasoline guys make a mean cup of coffee that never fails to keep my brain on point. The staff members are always so nice and accommodating - they’re always willing to point you to other options in their great selection of other drinks (caffeinated and non-caffeinated alike). Gasoline also has a nice assortment of pastries that make perfect snacks for pairing with your coffee while on the go. The super airy and bright space with entrances and massive windows on both sides is lovely year-round.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nI love supporting my local neighborhood businesses. As a small business owner myself, I understand the struggle and hardships as well as the strength and conviction needed to make an independent business work. It's a hustle all day everyday; I have the utmost respect for all the hustlers out there. Small businesses help improve their environments by bringing fresh concepts and ideas to a neighborhood, which is critical in keeping things interesting and inspiring for people who make up the community. While it’s tough, New York offers the possibility for someone to start any kind of small business imaginable, which is what makes this city is so special and unique.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Audrey%20Gingras%20Bowery%20Market.jpg\" alt=\"The Bowery Market\"><h2 id=\"the-bowery-market\">The Bowery Market</h2>\n<p>The Bowery Market offers all sorts of delicious fare and the pop-up / outdoor environment makes it an easy, perfect summer spot.

I&#39;ve now tried the fish tacos and the steak tacos and I can say they are some of the best I&#39;ve ever had - not just in NYC, I really mean ever! The bright color treatments on all of the shipping containers and the super cool people who work there may add to the whole experience, but damn if those tacos aren&#39;t addictive.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Audrey%20Gingras%20The%20Smile.jpg\" alt=\"The Smile\"><h2 id=\"the-smile\">The Smile</h2>\n<p>The Smile is my favorite lunch spot in the hood. The food is always delicious here and the menu has a lot of healthy options that manage to be super satisfying. As someone with a real sweet tooth, I always appreciate that The Smile has a solid dessert selection, but I always find myself opting for the chocolate chip &amp; sea salt cookies - I just love them so much. Carlos and Matt have done a great job of making The Smile a comfortable yet cool restaurant; it’s plain to see why it’s become the local institution that it is.  </p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Audrey%20Gingras%20Gasoline%20Alley.jpg\" alt=\"Gasoline Alley Coffee\"><h2 id=\"gasoline-alley-coffee\">Gasoline Alley Coffee</h2>\n<p>The Gasoline guys make a mean cup of coffee that never fails to keep my brain on point. The staff members are always so nice and accommodating - they’re always willing to point you to other options in their great selection of other drinks (caffeinated and non-caffeinated alike). Gasoline also has a nice assortment of pastries that make perfect snacks for pairing with your coffee while on the go. The super airy and bright space with entrances and massive windows on both sides is lovely year-round.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>I love supporting my local neighborhood businesses. As a small business owner myself, I understand the struggle and hardships as well as the strength and conviction needed to make an independent business work. It&#39;s a hustle all day everyday; I have the utmost respect for all the hustlers out there. Small businesses help improve their environments by bringing fresh concepts and ideas to a neighborhood, which is critical in keeping things interesting and inspiring for people who make up the community. While it’s tough, New York offers the possibility for someone to start any kind of small business imaginable, which is what makes this city is so special and unique.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-08-03 09:28 -0400","published":true,"title":"Audrey Gingras","description":"founder - <a href=\"http://www.archetypeshowroom.com/\">Archetype Showroom</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Audrey%20Gingras%20Main%20Portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Audrey Gingras","socialBlurb":"Archetype Showroom founder Audrey Gingras shares her 3 favorite businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@ArchetypeNYC founder Audrey Gingras shares her 3 favorite businesses in NYC"},{"name":"the-kid-mero","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-08-01 08:51 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: The Kid Mero\ndescription: '½ of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bodega-sushi\">Bodega Boys</a>'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/The%20Kid%20Mero%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: The Kid Mero '\nsocialBlurb: The Kid Mero of the Bodega Boys shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: .@THEKIDMERO of the @BodegaBoys shares his 3 favorite businesses in NY\n---\n![Tommy’s Pizza](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/The%20Kid's%20Mero%20Tommy's%20Pizza.jpg)\n## Tommy’s Pizza\nTOMMYS PIZZA IS ILL BECAUSE INSIDE ITS 1996, SHOUTOUT TO MY GUY JOE DOE WHO USED TO WORK THERE AND HIT ME WITH FREE SLICES WHEN I WAS SITTING IN THERE SMACKED ON A COLD WINTERS NIGHT.

I’m not really sure if I should give out any specific names or particular spots, though! I’ll usually keep it in the Meatpacking District, or the Village - I’m a big fan of Italian, steak, and seafood over anything else, so any place that is doing something interesting with that kind of cuisine, I’m there. \n\nOne second, John Starks is calling. ...What do you want, John Starks? I’m doing an interview right now, I’ll hit you when I’m done. \n\nAlright, ok - I’ll give you one: San Pietro. San Pietro on the Upper East Side - I’m pretty sure it’s not there anymore but we used to be at San Pietro a lot. These days, I’ll probably be at Catch or STK. Like I said, seafood and steak.\n\n## Mom & pop movie theaters\nOh, and of course - I’ve always been a big fan of going to the movies! I can’t name a specific theater that’d still be around, but back then, there were absolutely a lot more mom and pop-run theaters throughout the city. Especially in Times Square and in the Village. Then I remember when Magic [Johnson] decided to open his theaters - the one in Harlem and so on. But yeah, I would go to the movies whenever I could and, now that you’re putting me on the spot, it’s funny to remember how so many of them were family-owned operations compared to how it’s all big chains now.\n\n## Print shop\nA good friend of mine used to own a printing shop right up the street from the Garden - I’d go up there from time to time to hang out with him. I don’t remember the exact address but it was right on 7th Avenue just a few blocks up. You have to remember that, back then, you really had to go to the shop to get anything printed. So if I needed anything printed at all - cards, photos, anything else - he’d handle that for me. \n\n[Fabolous walks in]\n\nF: How you been, man?\n\nP: I’m good, man - just got into town.\n\nF: We got you back in the city?\n\nP: Yes sir. You know I always feel good when I’m back in the city.\n\nF: You hit the shop yet?\n\nP: I need to! I just got a cut yesterday so I’m good for a second. Actually, Fab just called it. The Shop (that’s the name of the barber shop) isn’t actually in the city - it’s out in Jersey, but Johnny is the guy there who cuts both our hair. For years now.\n\nF: Man, sometimes I can’t even get in a chair if Pat’s around!\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nP: It’s always a positive thing to support small, local businesses in the city. For all the obvious reasons - small businesses really help grow the economy, they generate jobs for people, they’re good for the communities they’re in - I think all of that is very important.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"san-pietro-and-new-york-steakhouses\">San Pietro and New York steakhouses</h2>\n<p>I have a long history with New York - one of my favorite things to this day is trying out restaurants I haven’t been to.

It’s the bodega and the pizza spot next door. They’re truly a Greenpoint staple. When we moved onto the block, they were super supportive of us right away. Connecting with Yvette and the whole crew at the deli was important to us because we wanted to be a business that has a reciprocal relationship with the community.

What was really nice was how they approached us while we were all over the place trying to get moved in while I was pregnant.

Do you guys need help with anything?” I think she was pretty excited to see another Spanish person opening up a business in the neighborhood.

Fool’s Gold is a business that I own with my brother A-Trak, Nick Catchdubs, and our business partner Ben Jacobs, who’s also general manager of the label. At its most essential, Fool’s Gold is a couple of things - it’s a record label and a brick and mortar record shop (which we’re actually in the process of moving and expanding). I think that, as Canadians who moved to New York, opening the physical shop was kind of like putting our stamp on the neighborhood we love - it was our way of being active contributors via the label, the shop, and the events side of our organization. So, as much as it is a place of business, it’s also the conduit we use to give back to our community; it’s how we invest in the cultural fabric of Williamsburg and Brooklyn. \n\n## Andrew Tarlow Restaurants\nI’m into all of the Andrew Tarlow restaurants - Marlow & Sons, Diner, Reynard at the Wythe Hotel, you name it. Diner was actually the first restaurant I went to when I moved to New York in 2002. Such a trailblazing establishment - I feel like they might have been the first restaurant to serve tap water in the city. Over the years, I’ve become very friendly with the staff - they’ve always been extremely welcoming to me. Oh, and the music at Marlow & Sons is just incredible. I’ve never Shazam’d more songs in my life at any other establishment. The phone reception there is terrible, too, so I’m always arms akimbo living that struggle Shazam life. I have a lot of love for all of those spots.\n\n## Ricky’s\nThe local business in New York I respect the most, however, is Ricky’s. It’s maybe the most iconic independent business in the city to me. That toothpaste tube is the most official logo in the game. Hands down. All that said, I actually don’t understand Ricky’s - I think it’s only a store for girlfriends. The selection is always something like: Halloween costumes, curlers, leggings, and affordable-but-clutch beauty products. When I’d visit New York as a kid throughout the 90s, I always assumed Ricky’s was a streetwear store. From the sidewalk, it always looked like that’s where you’d buy Freshjive pants. All the displays were so sparkly, but then I’d walk in and be like, “oh, wait...this is a drug store.” It’s incredible. I was in Soho yesterday and just saw they opened a new one on Lafayette or wherever - so, clearly, they’re thriving! Yeah - I’m a big Ricky’s fanboy. I’m waiting for that Supreme Ricky’s collabo.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n...That’s like asking me why it’s important to recycle and vote Democrat. Look, I’m not going to stand here and give you the whole...okay. Here’s the thing. Why we need to support independent businesses in this age of corporate monopolies...I shouldn’t even have to answer that. What I will say, however, is that it’s critical to support independent brick and mortar establishments - those are much harder to maintain. It’s just not necessary for you to leave your home to shop for anything anymore, so I have extra respect for people who put that effort in against the odds. These guys are committed to providing people who schlep to their spot with a real experience (as much as I hate that word). So, yeah - I have a ton of admiration for the customer who’ll get out of Amazon and into the urban jungle to support independent brick and mortar joints.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"fool-s-gold-records\">Fool’s Gold Records</h2>\n<p>Number one is always Fool’s Gold Records - this is home court.

Sweet Chick has unequivocally fulfilled all of my waffle needs. They make light, crispy, airy waffles - these are people who obviously know how to fold their egg whites. A great waffle is very crispy on the outside but a little soft at the core. That’s ideal. You don’t want it to be too doughy. A place that uses real maple syrup also shows me that they care about going the extra mile - it’s like great sushi - the fish has to be as good as the rice, and vice versa. It’s about the combination effect.\n\nWhen we lost Max Fish and Sweet Chick took the space on Ludlow, I was skeptical at first, but they’ve proven to be a great addition to the neighborhood. They understand and enhance the community around them - you can see how they give back and that they’re not just in it for the money. The chicken is great, as well. \n\n![Turntable Lab](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/David%20Perez%20Shadi%20Turntable%20Lab.jpg)\n## Turntable Lab\nTurntable Lab has been a part of the community for a long time now, and they’ve always stood on the fact that they have a great selection of hardware and software (including music). They’ve always kind of been in a niche spot, both in regards to their audience and where they sit in the neighborhood, but vinyl is bigger than ever and the guys have really capitalized on that momentum. The curation at Turntable Lab is really what it’s all about - I DJ so I’ll rent a lot of stuff from TTL...often, they’ll have stuff that no one else has. They’re a great resource for beginners and audiophiles alike; everyone who works there knows more than you do about music, but none of them will be condescending or treat you like shit. They talk you through everything, let you try stuff out, and price things fairly for you. You could buy stuff at Guitar Center or wherever, but I support Turntable Lab because they’ve always kept their feet in (and given back to) the East Village.\n\n![Dudley's](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/David%20Perez%20Shadi%20Dudleys.jpg)\n## Dudley’s\nDudley’s is the only place that makes a flat white the way I like it. I have an Aussie girlfriend who’s made me a connoisseur of Australian coffee techniques. The Australian coffee game is on point. The flat white at Dudley’s always wakes me up - I can’t say that about most other flat whites I’ve had in the city. The food is also great here; Dudley’s took over a space that was formerly occupied by a pretty snobby restaurant, and the crew has turned it into a great, accessible place to just hang out at. The owners are really good guys, you’ll always see a friendly face here, and for the ladies there’s always cute Aussie guys working here. Strong coffee, strong drinks, and strong food, \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nNew York has always been the backdrop to a lot of my videos. For “Jump Around” by House of Pain, we were at the Old Town Tavern. Little Italy always offered so much as a background - now that it’s shrunken and most of it is called Nolita, we’ve lost the postcard-like mystique the city had throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Real estate developers who don’t care about the heritage of the city keep making buildings that look like structures anywhere else. The bodegas we used to shoot at are gone. So, as a director, I’ll say that, in losing local businesses, we’ve lost a lot of the spirit and textures and locations that made us want to stay and work in New York.       \n\nAs someone who came up here, I’ve watched so many shit corporations take over and gentrify neighborhoods throughout the city. I wanted to take you to so many places that were important to me while I was growing up, but a lot of them are gone. I would have taken you to 2nd Avenue Deli, but that’s like a Chase Bank now...half of the other spots are condos. Small businesses are why people come to New York - they give the city (and every neighborhood in it) a distinct personality and voice. They reflect the people who’ve all gathered here to make New York their home. If we lose small businesses in New York, it’ll start looking like every other cookie cutter, strip mall town in America. We have to support small businesses to keep New York feeling like the place people want to visit.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/David%20Perez%20Shadi%20Sweet%20Chick.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet Chick\"><h2 id=\"sweet-chick\">Sweet Chick</h2>\n<p>Let me preface this by noting that I am a waffle connoisseur.

I have an Aussie girlfriend who’s made me a connoisseur of Australian coffee techniques. The Australian coffee game is on point. The flat white at Dudley’s always wakes me up - I can’t say that about most other flat whites I’ve had in the city. The food is also great here; Dudley’s took over a space that was formerly occupied by a pretty snobby restaurant, and the crew has turned it into a great, accessible place to just hang out at. The owners are really good guys, you’ll always see a friendly face here, and for the ladies there’s always cute Aussie guys working here. Strong coffee, strong drinks, and strong food, </p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>New York has always been the backdrop to a lot of my videos. For “Jump Around” by House of Pain, we were at the Old Town Tavern. Little Italy always offered so much as a background - now that it’s shrunken and most of it is called Nolita, we’ve lost the postcard-like mystique the city had throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Real estate developers who don’t care about the heritage of the city keep making buildings that look like structures anywhere else. The bodegas we used to shoot at are gone. So, as a director, I’ll say that, in losing local businesses, we’ve lost a lot of the spirit and textures and locations that made us want to stay and work in New York.       </p><p>As someone who came up here, I’ve watched so many shit corporations take over and gentrify neighborhoods throughout the city. I wanted to take you to so many places that were important to me while I was growing up, but a lot of them are gone. I would have taken you to 2nd Avenue Deli, but that’s like a Chase Bank now...half of the other spots are condos. Small businesses are why people come to New York - they give the city (and every neighborhood in it) a distinct personality and voice. They reflect the people who’ve all gathered here to make New York their home. If we lose small businesses in New York, it’ll start looking like every other cookie cutter, strip mall town in America. We have to support small businesses to keep New York feeling like the place people want to visit.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-08-08 19:08 -0400","published":true,"title":"David Perez Shadi","description":"<a href=\"http://www.shadinyc.com/\">photographer and director</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/David%20Perez%20Shadi%20Main%20Portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: David Perez Shadi","socialBlurb":"Photographer and director David Perez Shadi shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC","tweetText":"Photographer and director David Perez Shadi shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC"},{"name":"michael-chernow","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-08-01 09:20 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Michael Chernow\ndescription: >-\n  co-founder - <a href=\"http://www.themeatballshop.com/\">The Meatball Shop</a>,\n  founder - <a href=\"http://www.seamores.com/\">Seamore’s</a>\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Michael%20Chernow%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Michael Chernow '\nsocialBlurb: 'Michael Chernow shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC.

I don’t think it even has a name and the place looks like an absolute madhouse, but the guy who runs it is an old school Chinese dude named Ken who’s the most knowledgeable, meticulous person I’ve ever met. It’s unbelievable. This guy builds everything and just holds it down for the whole neighborhood. He does awnings, makes neon signs, cuts vinyl, does custom wraps, steel frames - you name it. He could probably build a building if you asked him to do it or take apart a car and piece it back together. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if he just came in here and ran the line at Seamore’s one day. To date, he’s helped me out with the neon I mentioned earlier, the metal frames that separate our sidewalk cafe from the sidewalk, the hanger up there on the wall for our merch...like I said, Ken is a guy who just handles shit. He’s the best.\n\n![Soho Strength Lab](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Michael%20Chernow%20Soho%20Strength%20Lab.jpg)\n## Soho Strength Lab\nSoho Strength Lab is where I get my sweat on. The trainers in there are super elite - they put me to WORK. It’s conveniently located right across the street from Seamore’s so I’m able to pop in there whenever I want and get my fucking beast on. I’ve been going there for over a year since we opened the restaurant, and the crew just keeps me in shape. That’s it. It’s amazing. Strength Lab is personal trainers only - I’d never worked out with a trainer before I started going there. So. I do spend a little dough on it, but it’s worth every cent because whenever I walk in I come out a better man.\n\n![Happy Bones](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Michael%20Chernow%20Happy%20Bones.jpg)\n## Happy Bones\nHappy Bones is right next door - they actually share this wall with Seamore’s and it’s the best coffee spot around. The guys who opened it up are all cool, extremely humble dudes. At this point we’re like family...we support each other fully - they send people to us, we send people to them. Good vibes, good people, good coffee. I’ve never had a bad espresso there, the atmosphere is always low-key and regular, and the majority of people who drink coffee in this neighborhood pop into Happy Bones for a reason. Also, Jason, the owner, is an old school friend of mine - we used to work together back in the day. He’s an amazing artist who travels all over the world painting these sick murals. All about supporting homies in the neighborhood.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nBecause if I didn’t support independent businesses, I could never expect independent businesses to support me. It’s all about family and representing for each other - if you need a cup of milk or a spoonful of sugar, I got you. Knock on the door and we’re always here for you, 24/7. The more we can do that, the better off we’ll all be as a community. \n\nAs someone who grew up in New York City, a lot of spots I’d always go to aren’t there anymore...and it’s definitely interesting to see what new businesses have come in to replace them. Big business is scary. I grew up in Manhattan and live in Williamsburg now, and it’s just insane to see all of these corporate spots open up all over Bedford. The grocery store around the corner? It’s a wrap as soon as Whole Foods came in. Doesn’t matter what anyone does or says - that’s it. You might as well pack your bags when you see that sign. It’s a very real problem - it’s hard enough running an independent business as is, but once a company backed with billions of dollars comes around, they’ll wipe you out. \n\nThat said, there’s also something to be said about being great. You can’t hate someone for being great - if a business comes around and just kills it because they know what they’re doing, you have to respect that in a certain way. So, my advice to independent business owners like me is don’t focus on what other people are doing, focus on being great. If you’re great, you have nothing to worry about - if you’re good, it’s a wrap. Take Seamore’s, for example - fish tacos aren’t anything new - if people don’t like mine they just won’t come back. They’ll just go to Rosa Mexicano or wherever. So my focus at Seamore’s is to make the greatest fish taco I can - if that’s on point, people will come through, and I’m happy. Simple.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Michael%20Chernow%20Ken.jpg\" alt=\"Ken\"><h2 id=\"ken\">Ken</h2>\n<p>So there’s this spot on the corner of Broome and Elizabeth - I rolled up on it out of the blue while I was trying to figure out how to get a neon sign made for Seamore’s.

They could go the arguably easier route and wholesale, so I think it’s very admirable that they take the extra steps to connect directly with their customers.

I’ve been coming here for years to buy ingredients both for myself and the restaurant. You’ll notice that there are a bunch of things that you can find at other supermarkets or stores, but the pricing is much fairer and and the selection is far more extensive here. Of course, there are also things like pandan leaf that you can’t really find at too many shops in Manhattan, at least. I really love how everyone who works is here is so knowledgable, patient, and generous with their time. They’ll really go out of their way to help you figure out exactly what you’re looking for and even stuff that you didn’t know you needed.

You don’t think this neighborhood when you think of Dover Street or CdG, and vice versa. I’m the kind of person who wears a lot of basics; I’ll buy maybe one item of clothing a month. But when I do buy clothes, I like to buy pieces that are quality...stuff that will last for a long time. \n\nI’m also a big fan of Comme des Garcons and their point of view, so it’s exciting to get lost in how they curate offerings from other brands. There’s a parallel between DSM and Kalustyan’s in the sense that they both offer that encyclopedic experience - I learn so much from just walking around both of these places and seeing how they organize and juxtapose things. The top floor at DSM has Supreme and Prada sitting next to each other - this is the only store in the world that could make that pairing work. And I love learning about how they go about accomplishing that. \n\n![The Cannibal](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Deuki%20Hong%20The%20Cannibal.jpg)\n## The Cannibal\nMy friend Cory Lane, who was with me at Momofuku, is one of the owners of The Cannibal. I actually came by The Cannibal the first few times without knowing Cory was involved - one day, I saw him and it was one of those -  “what the hell are you doing here?” “wait, what the hell are YOU doing here?” situations. He then tells me he owns the place and I’m like, shit! \n\nSo The Cannibal is all about head-to-toe cooking - that’s when they use every aspect of the animal. Little to nothing gets wasted. I’m a big fan of that approach. The best thing about these guy is that they take risks - everything is bold. Some choices pay off better than others, but Francis Derby is an incredibly talented chef who makes it work. I mean, bone marrow brulee - what an iconic dish. \n\nTo continue the theme of encyclopedic experiences - I’d definitely say that The Cannibal’s beer selection is extremely underrated. You can find some weird, super niche stuff that you’d never even come across at the best bars or pubs in the city. They’re hunting all the time and really keeping the curation tight - some beers they’ll have, say, a dozen bottles of and then you won’t see that brand again for another four months. More people need to check that beer selection out.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nI don’t have a really philosophical answer for this...my answer is that I just wouldn’t want every business in my neighborhood or city to be the same. I’d never want to live somewhere that’s all Wal-Marts and Burger Kings. You can’t learn anything from places like that. You want that individuality in businesses you frequent because that means there’s a personal interaction to be had with the people who own it. When I’m at Kalustyan’s, the people who work there will always ask me if I’ve tried this thing they just got in last week. Same thing with my friends who work at Dover Street. They put me onto stuff and help me push my own boundaries. \n\nThe most important thing is that there’s a balance between the big and little guys. No knock to Wal-Mart - I’m Korean. I love a good deal. I’ll go nuts in a Wal-Mart. But what I’m saying is that you don’t want it all to tip one way or the other. There has to be a healthy balance.

When you walk in it’s pretty clear that this is the kind of place that was probably commonplace in the city 30, 40 years ago. There are just used, primarily film, cameras everywhere. When you walk in the back there are buckets that they’ve thrown all kinds of lenses in. I never know what people do with them - maybe they’re for parts? Then you have your Leica area, your Pentaxes, and, all the way in the back is the super nerd medium format section. I just bought a mint condition Contax G2 there the other day. You could probably find a bunch of the stuff they sell on eBay, but there’s nothing like being able to walk in and test everything out.\n\n## Five Leaves\n\n**Alex:** Five Leaves is a restaurant right by my house in Greenpoint, so I go there quite a bit. It’s nice that it still feels like a comfortable, neighborhood spot even though it draws a fairly large crowd now. I also like that you can get a coffee there pretty early in the morning and get a drink later on. I’ll sit outside and hang out. It just has a good vibe.\n\n## Public School\n\n**Alex:** Max and Dao at Public School are friends and frequent collaborators of ours. They’re one of a few brands that are not only designing in New York, but manufacturing their product here as well. That’s really compelling to us because a lot of our work is made in New York, too. When you work with, say, fabricators or contractors here, you pay a premium for that, but the upside is being able to source materials locally and create this exchange with the community. So, it’s great to see designers in fashion be very deliberate with those choices as well.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\n**Alex:** Well, we’re an independent business. If you’ve gone through that, if you live it, you understand the drive required to run your own company. So you have to support (or at least respect) it when other people commit to doing the same thing. We’re all in it together.\n\n**Daniel:** I also think that, especially in creative fields, Independent businesses are where innovation happens - it’s where things move forward.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"k-m-camera\">K&amp;M Camera</h2>\n<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> So K&amp;M is this camera shop in lower Manhattan that specializes in film.

The Strand is an iconic example, but the selection there is sort of overwhelming. When you want to focus in on a perfectly curated collection of books, Mast is unbeatable. I almost hate walking by there because it’s guaranteed that something I didn’t even know I wanted (and is probably super expensive) will catch my eye. To be honest, the experience messes with my head a little because I’d like to think that I’m an individual, but whenever I’m at Mast it’s like, “wow, everything these guys put on the shelf is a book that I like. Maybe my tastes aren’t as unique as I thought.” And that’s before you even get to their rare books cabinet, which is just as ridiculous as it gets.\n\n![Fatoosh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Brent-Rollins-Fatoosh.jpg)\n\n## Fatoosh\n\nFatoosh is a small Middle Eastern falafel and pizza joint. I’ve been in this neighborhood for about two decades and I’ve been a regular at Fatoosh for 19 of those years - these guys introduced me to the concept of Middle Eastern pizza with the spiced lamb and all that. They bake their own bread in-house, too, which is awesome. My order is their fish sandwich - for $7 there’s no way you can beat it (I also haven’t seen another Middle Eastern spot in the neighborhood that has one). They also keep the tabbouleh, ful, and falafel in a glass refrigerator up front so you can pick what you want...Fatoosh is just simple, man. Perfect in its simplicity.\n\n![Court Street Bagels](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Brent-Rollins-Court-Street-Bagels.jpg)\n\n## Court Street Bagels\n\nSo if I’ve been going to Fatoosh for 19 out of the 20 years I’ve lived in the neighborhood, I’ve definitely been going to Court Street for all 20. The owner is an old school Brooklyn cat who, for whatever reason, strikes me as a Yankees fan. I’ve always felt that he’s doing a service for the community more than running a business, per se. He knows all of his customers by name, including me, and his staff is always comprised of young people in their first jobs. There are a bunch of other bagel spots that have opened up in the neighborhood, but Court Street is the one I’ve always been able to count on. My order is a veggie egg white omelette on a roll with cheese - I feel like I order it enough that they should have named it after me by this point. It hasn’t happened yet, but I’m still holding out for the Brentfast Sandwich.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nOne of the reasons that I left California twenty years ago and moved to New York was because I disliked how many chain stores there were all over LA. I understand that there a lot of geographical and socioeconomic reasons that account for why it’s like that, but I really appreciated coming to New York and having individual, one-on-one experiences with business owners...I value how human that experience is immensely.

It was actually the first store I visited when I moved here and I've gone back for my haircuts ever since. Everyone on the team at Headz pays an incredible amount of attention to detail - all of the barbers treat every cut like it’s a work of art. The collages and murals on the wall, depicting: Nas, Jay-Z, Big Pun, Scarface, Goodfellas, the Godfather, and even the 7 train completely sets them apart.\n\n![Arunee Thai](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Graham%20Browne%20Arunee%20Thai.jpg)\n## Arunee Thai\n\nI struggle with this: do I tell everyone how good this place is or do I tell no one? I thought that I knew what good Thai food was until I stepped into Arunee for the first time. The curries are so rich and flavorful and their duck dishes are absolutely unmatched.

It was actually the first store I visited when I moved here and I&#39;ve gone back for my haircuts ever since. Everyone on the team at Headz pays an incredible amount of attention to detail - all of the barbers treat every cut like it’s a work of art. The collages and murals on the wall, depicting: Nas, Jay-Z, Big Pun, Scarface, Goodfellas, the Godfather, and even the 7 train completely sets them apart.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Graham%20Browne%20Arunee%20Thai.jpg\" alt=\"Arunee Thai\"><h2 id=\"arunee-thai\">Arunee Thai</h2>\n<p>I struggle with this: do I tell everyone how good this place is or do I tell no one?

TTL actually started in an apartment on 12th street between 1st and 2nd Ave; that original location is where I bought my very first mixer. Three guys who are my age came up with the idea - Peter, Anthony, and Jasper - they were like, “yo, let’s start a company and call it Turntable Lab,” and thus, Turntable Lab 001 was born. They went through another location a few years later and are now at this storefront. If you look at the sign it says Turntable Lab 003, signifying that it is, indeed, the third location for TTL. Man. It seems like yesterday they were just getting off the ground - sixteen years later they’re seniors in this thing. I don’t know how the hell that happened!\n\nTTL was always very specific in its curation - its core audience is comprised of audiophiles, vinyl collectors, and music heads. The selection of equipment and records here is peerlessly handpicked - you’re never going to find anything cheap or gimmicky. It’s strictly the best of the best. The staff are also some of the nicest people you’ll meet at a record store - no snobs like John Cusack in High Fidelity. If you come up to someone and ask them, “hey, what mixer should I get? I’m just starting out,” no one’s going to go “what the hell’s wrong with you?” They’ll help you out - it’s a very safe space! \n\nOh, it also has to be said that Turntable Lab’s website is great. In the beginning, all of the stuff you could buy through their site was all geared towards the customer with a real turntablist mentality - battle records and so on. But as they’ve adapted, they’ve started to sell things like re-presses of The Pixies’ LPs, clothes, books, and equipment for all skill levels and kinds of DJs. So it’s a testament to the guys that they were able to recognize the need to diversify their offering if they wanted to grow their business and audience. 16 years as a storefront - my God. I mean, Fat Beats closed. Tower Records closed. You gotta respect the Lab, man.\n\n![Stadium Goods](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/DJ%20Neil%20Armstrong%20Stadium%20Goods.jpg)\n## Stadium Goods\nI’m partial to these guys because I’ve known the homies who started it for a long, long time. Especially JDM and Yu-Ming (who I actually met my manager, Sky, through)! As you can see, they went all out with the store - it’s massive and very thought out. I’m glad to see them doing so well despite being new to the scene. You always have Complex filming in here, you have half the NFL in here, you have Cam’ron in here talking about his Fleeboks - Stadium Goods is on. \n\nLike Turntable Lab, it’s all about the level of service you get here. The staff are all excellent - none of them are going to shit on you for not knowing what you’re talking about. They’ll take the time to help you browse through their insane collection and figure everything out - it’s no surprise that people end up dropping $21,000 (this happened the other day)...that just speaks to the quality of the experience. If you’re a sneakerhead, or even casually interested in sneakers, this is the place to be.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIf I step back and think about it, it always amazes me that by supporting independent businesses like Turntable Lab and Stadium Goods, I get the opportunity to support my friends. When I DJ for a big company, does that actually help my buddy who works there? Maybe a little bit, but probably not so much in the long run. However, if I do the same thing for SG or TTL, I can actually see how it helps their bottom line. So by contributing the tiny amount I can to their growth, I get to share in the sense of pride that comes with these businesses’ ongoing success.

Every neighborhood needs a local, and Grand Army is quickly becoming that for Boerum Hill just a year into business. The drinks are great, the oysters are awesome, and it feels really comfortable. I get the same kind of feeling at Grand Army that I hope our customers associate with The Smile.    \n\n## GRDN\nGRDN is also on Hoyt right next to Mile End by the parking lot - that’s where I buy my plants and herbs. I find gardening to be a really therapeutic activity. GRDN is just a beautifully merchandised store with a great assortment of flowers, herbs, plants, supplies, and accessories. The way they curate that assortment is really fantastic. I’m pretty sure they’ve been around for a while; it was the first shop we walked into when we moved into the neighborhood. They recently gave my wife a bunch of flowers for a dinner party we were hosting - we would have gladly paid full price for them, but they were like, “no, no - they’ll only be good for a few days.” It’s a really nice thing to be able to build that personal connection with business owners in your area. We’re getting there with the GRDN guys.\n\n## The Primary Essentials\nThe Primary Essentials is a really fantastic store on Atlantic. They specialize in curating home goods, books, and objects that you probably won’t find anywhere else. There are so many random things that you didn’t know you needed that you’ll end up buying at Primary - I recently walked out with a bunch of pillows and this set of old brass nails. They care so much about the selection of goods on the floor there, and the atmosphere is so peaceful and serene. It’s just one of those places that you’re always drawn to. I’m a big supporter of places that can maintain a feeling of authenticity, and Primary really delivers on that across the entirety of their business.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nTo answer that, I think it’s important to understand the risk you’re taking when you decide to start your own business. The very nature of that undertaking is - if you don’t hit a homerun your first time out, the reality is that it gets significantly harder to start another one. Things never go to script, there aren’t any safety nets for you to fall back on, and the whole journey is mostly trials and tribulations. Additionally, the conditions that you can’t control personally aren’t getting any easier to deal with - whether we’re talking rent or whatever else. \n\nSo, one of the special things about independent business owners is that the emotional investment they put into their businesses is incomparable. When you walk into any of the places I just mentioned, you know that they’re very intimate, full reflections of who the owners are. The personality you experience and associate with independent businesses is something that you just can’t find at larger chains, or even a company that’s setting itself up to become a bigger chain. So, in effect, choosing to support an independent business is an act of respect; it’s acknowledging the tremendous risk and challenges inherent to starting your own thing.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"grand-army\">Grand Army</h2>\n<p>Grand Army is a bar on State and Hoyt (about three blocks from where I live) that’s run by a couple of excellent restaurateurs - [Noah] Bernamoff and Julian [Brizzi].

I've had business meetings, design meetings (yes I had my line plan and design sheets scattered all over the table), I even had my 35th birthday here. My birthday is in December so going out on a freezing cold night at my age sounds sort of terrible terrible, so I invited my girlfriends in the neighborhood for a Purity breakfast.

I love that their selection of goods is also well edited, I think it helps customers make better / more intentional purchases.

I'm Chinese (no doubt), but I grew up with a real soft spot for the kind of \"Chinese food\" that consisted of lunch-counter stuff covered in sweet and sour glaze. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as a Kung Pao shrimp and pork fried rice dinner special. Kum Kau is the best of its kind, and has been doing it right since 1971.

Sisters not only looks really nice, it also feels really nice to be at, too. It’s pretty without being pretentious; they serve some really fancy, delicious cocktails, but no one will look at you funny if you ask for a beer-and-shot special. I have a tendency here to roll up during an empty Saturday afternoon and accidentally stay until closing.\n\n![Yo-C](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/ConnieWangYo-C_w1280.jpg)\n\n## Yo-C\n\nI started coming to Yo-C just because it was the nearest hair salon to my old apartment, but my laziness ended up paying off. Yoshi and his staff are meticulous about hair. I swear he cuts each follicle one at a time and paints each strand individually — and for proof of his technique, I just have to look at the state of his entire staff’s hair.

I&#39;m Chinese (no doubt), but I grew up with a real soft spot for the kind of &quot;Chinese food&quot; that consisted of lunch-counter stuff covered in sweet and sour glaze. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as a Kung Pao shrimp and pork fried rice dinner special. Kum Kau is the best of its kind, and has been doing it right since 1971. I’m part of the neighborhood cult now, and better off because of it.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/ConnieWangSisters_w1280.jpg\" alt=\"Sisters\"><h2 id=\"sisters\">Sisters</h2>\n<p>For the most part, I’m wary of bars that are too “designed” — it’s like, how am I supposed to get all mellow when I’m basically sitting in an Anthropologie showroom, you know? Sisters not only looks really nice, it also feels really nice to be at, too. It’s pretty without being pretentious; they serve some really fancy, delicious cocktails, but no one will look at you funny if you ask for a beer-and-shot special. I have a tendency here to roll up during an empty Saturday afternoon and accidentally stay until closing.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/ConnieWangYo-C_w1280.jpg\" alt=\"Yo-C\"><h2 id=\"yo-c\">Yo-C</h2>\n<p>I started coming to Yo-C just because it was the nearest hair salon to my old apartment, but my laziness ended up paying off. Yoshi and his staff are meticulous about hair. I swear he cuts each follicle one at a time and paints each strand individually — and for proof of his technique, I just have to look at the state of his entire staff’s hair. They’ve literally all got the platonic ideal of what hair should look like (I mean, look at <a href=\"http://www.yo-csalon.com/index.php?&amp;module=staff\">this pic</a> of his partner, Rieko).

I've always been a big coffee drinker, but until I moved to East Williamsburg seven years ago, I wasn't lucky enough to live near a great coffee shop. Since then, it's become part of that daily vector—someone else's business that's become an extension of my own life. My days feel patently off without stopping in there first. And while it happens to be one of the best coffee shops in the city, it's so much more to me—and the neighborhood—than that. I've worked my ass off there: It's the place where I ran Gawker out of for a year on weekends early on in my career, from the moment they opened, until the moment they closed. I've made friends there. I've learned about things there, from the people behind the counter, my neighbors, and so on. There's not enough space here to write as effusively in praise of Variety as it deserves, so I'll just say this: Their cold brew is the shit, drinkable year-round, miss at your own peril.\n\n![Crest Hardware](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Crest%20Hardware.jpg)\n## Crest Hardware\nBy all appearances, just another hardware store, until you get to know Harrison, the Macaw who chills in the garden center, or Franklin, the (second-generation) owner Joe Franquinha's pot-bellied pig who's posted in the backyard. It's a hardware store that hosts art shows, Halloween parties, short film festivals. It's a hardware store where people have worked for fifty years. It's a hardware store that has everything you need, and nothing you don't. It's a hardware store that doubles as a community center. It's a hardware store where you'll walk around in the backyard on a Sunday afternoon and look at plants because it's just a nice, meditative thing to do, and they're totally okay with people doing that. So yeah, it's just a hardware store, but also, a weirdly inspiring and perfect one for this neighborhood, where it's become a weirdly critical institution, and not just because they sell hammers. But yes: Hammers are also important, and this is where you go in Williamsburg to buy one.\n\n![Diner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Diner.jpg)\n## Diner\nDiner's become one of the most essential restaurants in the city simply by being itself, not kowtowing to trends, not making any kind of changes as the neighborhood around it has shifted entirely. It's a fussy place—it's loud, it's fun, it's built into an old dining car, most of the menu (which changes, daily) is written on butcher paper on your table, and your meal will soundtracked with anything from Leonard Cohen to Lil' Wayne (possibly in the same hour). It's got one of the most romantic locales in the city, smack under the Williamsburg Bridge. But the brilliance of Diner is its out-and-out utility: You can stop in dolo for coffee and eggs, or a burger and beer. You can also get some of the most brilliantly composed dishes on that same menu at a party of a meal with friends. It's the rare place that manages to have something for everyone, and again, it's become that place by not giving a shit about what's happened around it. Anyway: If I care about you as a human being, we've probably eaten at Diner together, or will at some point. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIt's not hard to see why supporting independent businesses is substantially important to supporting what you love about a city. Just flip the proposition, right? You vote with your wallet. Is supporting chain stores and franchises backing what you love about New York? If the answer is \"yes,\" please flush yourself back to Jersey, or Rockland County, or Cleveland, or wherever. I don't know about you people, but I moved here to move to Nora Ephron's New York, DFA's New York, Spy's New York, and so much of those people's output and the New York that helped them create it revolved around the way they transacted their lives when they weren't doing that. And those people weren't going to Whole Foods, or some shitty midtown sad desk salad chain—they were going to Katz's, Diner, Elaine's, etc. When you support this city's independent businesses, you support the identity of New York as established and defined and propagated by those who live here, who want it to be better than the increasingly indistinguishable, suburban, and middlebrow lameass identity of growing cities around the country. We put up with too much shit here to not have it be better than that.

You might have seen him in the video where he’s riding around on a Citi Bike. They’ve supported me since day one, so I’m always grateful to be able to support him, as well. Obviously everyone at Dah Shop understands BMX so we’ve become really good friends. I love that spot. I’ve been going by for about eight years now, ever since they opened. They really fuel the BMX scene down here, especially because they’re so close to the skate park. If you have a part that breaks, you can walk over pretty quickly and chill with everyone while they fix it for you. Dah Shop is the central hub for anyone who rides downtown - it keeps the scene alive.\n\n## Chalk Point Kitchen\nThe second spot I’d pick is Chalk Point at 528 Broome. I support Chalk Point because my good friend Matt Levine owns it. Matt’s been deep in the game for a long, long time - we actually met through my homie Ryan Sheckler and since then, he’s supported what I do and I’ve supported what he does. It’s always a good feeling to be able to support my friends in their endeavors. Chalk Point specializes in organic food - every time you go there for dinner, you know everything’s sourced from local farms and businesses in the area. I love everything on the menu. Oh, also, they run this incredible bar downstairs called The Handy Bar. It’s a super low-key, classic New York City spot. I’m chilling there and getting a drink whenever I can. \n\n## Bill’s Bike Shop\nBill’s Bike Shop is on Roosevelt out in Queens. Before I went pro, I used to go there all the time to get my bike fixed. Those guys have always been super supportive of my pursuit of being a professional BMX rider. The owner, Mark, is one of the people who really fueled my ambition to do what I do today. So I always gotta support him, as well. Bill’s is a general bike shop, but they really get BMX. \n\nMan, when I was coming up, the guys at the bike shop in my neighborhood in Queens were just assholes, so I’d always travel to Bill’s because they were nice and they understood the culture. Other BMX riders would always be there so it was an added bonus to be able to socialize with all of them and be amongst that NYC BMX community. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIt’s extremely important to support independent businesses - they’re the ones that are actually of, and not just in, a community. That means they’re providing opportunity to people in a neighborhood and the interactions you have with them are more personal and intimate.\n\nMy foundation and support system before I went pro was all local businesses. Them fueling me and me supporting them right back - that mutual relationship was essential to getting me where I’m at today.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"dah-shop\">Dah Shop</h2>\n<p>My first spot is definitely Dah Shop down on Division, owned by my boy Tyrone who was a local New York City pro I followed while I was growing up.

As far as fancy, upscale pizza is concerned, L’asso is one of the best joints in the city. At least for me. So when Scarr, who used to work everywhere from L’asso to Lombardi’s to Joe’s, left to start his own spot up - I basically just followed him. The food’s great; I almost had a heart attack the first time I went in there thanks to their meatball sub, which is toasted and has (obviously) a ton of meatballs and cheese in it. Really simple but it’s an amazing sandwich. As you can see, the interior and signage is crazy too - Scarr designed it so the space looks like something straight out of a movie from the ‘70s or ‘80s. This place is tight.\n\n![Cheeky Sandwiches](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jillionaire%20Cheeky%20Sandwiches.jpg)\n## Cheeky Sandwiches\nJ: Cheeky probably has the best chicken biscuit in the city. It’s really in the cut down here on Orchard - if you didn’t know what you were looking for, you’d walk right past it. In fact, I know that I want that chicken biscuit and I’ll still miss the door sometimes like “yo, what happened?” It’s definitely one of my favorite spots downtown. Actually, I blame this guy sitting next to me for putting me on. I’ve known OJ for almost ten years now - easy - and I’ve learned a lot from him. Mostly bad stuff. Anyways, that’s Cheeky. Oh, the owner is a chef from New Orleans.\n\nOJ: Yeah, he used to actually be a model and one day decided, “nah, fuck that - I wanna cook.” So that’s it - now he makes these chicken sandwiches wearing the same white v-neck all day every day. That’s the chef.\n\nJ: It gets crazy busy and it’s a small space, but if you go during off hours you can catch them when it’s kind of quieter.\n\nOJ: You know who I used to see in there all the time? Leonardo DiCaprio. He’d roll down the block on his CitiBike, get off, roll right in, his beard would follow, and he’d walk out with a chicken sandwich. All the time.\n\nJ: You gotta respect that guy.\n\n![La Petite Mort](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jillionaire%20La%20Petite%20Mort.jpg)\n## La Petite Mort\nJ: This is OJ’s spot. OJ - what should I say about LPM?\n\nOJ: Ummmm…as much as LPM is a commercial space where they sell stuff, it’s more of a community center.

As far as fancy, upscale pizza is concerned, L’asso is one of the best joints in the city. At least for me. So when Scarr, who used to work everywhere from L’asso to Lombardi’s to Joe’s, left to start his own spot up - I basically just followed him. The food’s great; I almost had a heart attack the first time I went in there thanks to their meatball sub, which is toasted and has (obviously) a ton of meatballs and cheese in it. Really simple but it’s an amazing sandwich. As you can see, the interior and signage is crazy too - Scarr designed it so the space looks like something straight out of a movie from the ‘70s or ‘80s. This place is tight.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jillionaire%20Cheeky%20Sandwiches.jpg\" alt=\"Cheeky Sandwiches\"><h2 id=\"cheeky-sandwiches\">Cheeky Sandwiches</h2>\n<p>J: Cheeky probably has the best chicken biscuit in the city. It’s really in the cut down here on Orchard - if you didn’t know what you were looking for, you’d walk right past it. In fact, I know that I want that chicken biscuit and I’ll still miss the door sometimes like “yo, what happened?” It’s definitely one of my favorite spots downtown. Actually, I blame this guy sitting next to me for putting me on. I’ve known OJ for almost ten years now - easy - and I’ve learned a lot from him. Mostly bad stuff. Anyways, that’s Cheeky. Oh, the owner is a chef from New Orleans.</p><p>OJ: Yeah, he used to actually be a model and one day decided, “nah, fuck that - I wanna cook.” So that’s it - now he makes these chicken sandwiches wearing the same white v-neck all day every day. That’s the chef.</p><p>J: It gets crazy busy and it’s a small space, but if you go during off hours you can catch them when it’s kind of quieter.</p><p>OJ: You know who I used to see in there all the time? Leonardo DiCaprio. He’d roll down the block on his CitiBike, get off, roll right in, his beard would follow, and he’d walk out with a chicken sandwich. All the time.</p><p>J: You gotta respect that guy.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jillionaire%20La%20Petite%20Mort.jpg\" alt=\"La Petite Mort\"><h2 id=\"la-petite-mort\">La Petite Mort</h2>\n<p>J: This is OJ’s spot. OJ - what should I say about LPM?</p><p>OJ: Ummmm…as much as LPM is a commercial space where they sell stuff, it’s more of a community center. They sell really great vintage and incredible work by local artists and designers who show here. Oh and once in awhile we’ll get bored and throw really big, crazy concerts in the middle of the street.</p><p>J: And somehow, I’ll always end up getting involved.</p><p>OJ: Yes.

At the time, I didn’t really see it and wondered if she could give me an example of a restaurant that was in that lane. Fast forward a few years and I found myself recalling that conversation when a buddy of mine told me that we should check out Chikarashi. We went together and I was really blown away with how well the concept is executed here. Everything about it feels great and, of course, it’s in this really interesting location right on the north side of Chinatown. There aren’t too many restaurants of that caliber in Chikarashi’s direct vicinity - it’s cool to see these guys bring that level of cooking to Chinatown or Nolita or whatever this area technically is. \n\nIt’s super convenient and accessible, but you have to go during off-hours because you can’t even step inside during lunch. I really like the whole idea and execution behind Chikarashi.\n\n![Magic](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Simonez%20Wolf%20Magic.jpg)\n## Magic\nMagic is at the top of like a five floor walkup at 175 Canal, not too far from Chikarashi, actually. It’s run by my guy, Gogy. I found out about this whole operation when I followed my friend here while he was getting a cut (at the time, I had a different barber). They do a lot of stuff in this space - Magic is as much an art gallery where a lot of up and coming artists have shows as it is a barbershop. Gogy will also show his own work from time to time; he’s a really talented photographer and multimedia-style artist. It’s a really interesting experience - hard to find, but a really beautiful loft space that’s quiet with great light. Hidden right in the middle of Canal Street. That feels really rare and old school New York to me. \n\nGogy has a deep rolodex of customers - he’s super plugged into the culture. For instance, when Supreme will do editorials or lookbooks, they call him to do all the grooming. He’s cutting hair for a lot of people who everyone knows, but I won’t blow up their spot here.\n\n![Miscelanea NY](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Simonez%20Wolf%20Miscelanea.jpg)\n## Miscelanea NY\nAnna Sheffield told her boyfriend about Miscelanea, who then told a bunch of us. She kept insisting that we had to visit this spot that no one had heard of or seen before, like, it’s on East 4th between Bowery and 2nd and none of us could even visualize it. So I made a point of finding it and immediately fell in love with the whole concept. Miscelanea is this contemporary, Mexican style grocery full of bric a bracs, prepackaged stuff from Mexico, magazines you can only get in Mexico, small bites, their own products, drinks like horchatas...the full spread. The vibe is really good in here - everyone is super friendly and the concept is so clear. This kind of store, to me, is what New York needs more of - not CVS’s. You can get actual groceries and a meal here, but it’s also such a good representation of the owners’ culture. I’ll always support people who run businesses like these.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nSmall businesses are crucial to the economy of any city. Look what happens when we don’t support independent businesses in New York - the entire city starts turning into a giant, outdoor shopping mall. You lose the spirit that neighborhoods are built on. Everything gets turned into a corporate version of what it was, whether it’s a Starbucks taking over a local cafe, or a Duane Reade moving in where there used to be like a mom and pop drug store. That’s really sad to me. Do you want to live in a city that’s all branches of big banks and pharmacies? I can’t imagine that’s true for anyone, even people who work at big banks and pharmacies. If I wanted to live by a mall I’d move to Dallas or wherever. There’s something incomparable about being on a first name basis with the owner of a business you support - they know your habits, what you like and need...how can any big retailer beat that? \n\nLook, I understand how capitalism works and that it’s not really something that we can stop, but if I can slow it down a bit by supporting independent businesses I’m happy to do that for as long as I can.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Simonez%20Wolf%20Chikarashi.jpg\" alt=\"Chikarashi\"><h2 id=\"chikarashi\">Chikarashi</h2>\n<p>A couple years ago, before I opened Football Cafe, I remember this girl telling me that I should look into starting a poke spot.

When I map out my six years in NYC, the one constant is L Train, and I’m fine with that. It has all the wonders of a down south GoodWill organized with the curatorial eye of a Fresh Prince of Bel Air costumier. My personal style is 90s cult film extra, so it goes without saying that L Train is my Mecca. They have everything from Air Force Ones to military grade jumpsuits to every single style of Levis created. Almost everything goes for $5-$20, so no regrets on purchasing that sequined pantsuit.\n\nM: I’m not someone who seeks out L Train to find things that I love, but I do love all the things that I’ve gotten from this place. There are a lot of pieces that have become staples in my closet that without L Train - and Yasmin - I wouldn’t own.

It was introduced to me by a friend and it’s quickly become a favorite place to spend my time and money. Filled with leather jackets, patches, knives, taxidermy, and custom embroidery work done by the shop’s owner Amanda, it’s every metal head’s dream! This store embodies and personifies New York’s “by any means necessary” mentality. It was broken into not long ago and Amanda and the girls lost a lot of inventory, but what would’ve ruined most didn’t stop them. It’s that type of can-do resilience that I admire in her and all small business owners.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nY: I grew up in Haiti where every business is an independent business. To me, independent businesses feel like home; someone knows your name, or at least recognizes your face, and you sense a realness in that place that you don’t feel with chains and big brands. Independent businesses are the backbone of the United States and, frankly, the local places in New York are part of what makes the city alive.\n\nM: My father was born in Brooklyn and spent a large portion of his childhood in the Bronx - my mom was raised in the LES. I’ve spent my entire life in New York, so I have a real serious relationship with the city, especially now that I live here myself. Small businesses and the people who own them are the heart and soul of this city. We all need to do our part to continue to support local businesses - without them, this place wouldn’t feel like home.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Yas%20and%20Mac%20Dillinger&#39;s.jpg\" alt=\"Dillinger&#39;s\"><h2 id=\"dillinger-s\">Dillinger’s</h2>\n<p>Y: This place fills a void in the neighborhood for me.

Independent businesses are the backbone of the United States and, frankly, the local places in New York are part of what makes the city alive.</p><p>M: My father was born in Brooklyn and spent a large portion of his childhood in the Bronx - my mom was raised in the LES. I’ve spent my entire life in New York, so I have a real serious relationship with the city, especially now that I live here myself. Small businesses and the people who own them are the heart and soul of this city. We all need to do our part to continue to support local businesses - without them, this place wouldn’t feel like home.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-08-23 14:38 -0400","published":true,"title":"Yasmin Daguilh and Mackenzie Gleason","description":"creative content producer - <a href=\"https://www.aliceandolivia.com/\">Alice & Olivia</a> / head bartender - <a href=\"http://thewaylandnyc.com/\">The Wayland</a>","fbTitle":"For New York: Yasmin Daguilh and Mackenzie Gleason","socialBlurb":"Yasmin Daguilh and Mackenzie Gleason share their 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@whyasmin and Mackenzie Gleason share their 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Yas%20and%20Mac%20Main%20Portrait.jpg"},{"name":"ryan-serhant","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-10-17 09:47 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Ryan Serhant\ndescription: '<a href=\"http://ryanserhant.com/\">real estate agent and TV personality</a>'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ryan%20Serhant%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Ryan Serhant'\nsocialBlurb: >-\n  Real estate agent and TV personality, Ryan Serhant, shares his 3 favorite\n  independent businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: .@RyanSerhant shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC.\n---\n![The Dogpound](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ryan%20Serhant%20Dogpound.jpg)\n## The Dogpound\nThe Dogpound is significant to me for two reasons - one, being completely honest - it’s the location: they’re right across the street from where I live. Them being here, specifically, validated a lot of my thinking when I bought my place down on Renwick a few years ago. This was when everyone else in real estate was like, “what? That’s a dead zone - it’s not Soho, it’s not Tribeca.” Six months later, The Dogpound - whose members include Hugh Jackman, Nigel Barker, and numerous high-profile models - opens up on that corner and now you’ve got this whole neighborhood popping up around it. \n\nSecondly, there’s a community and atmosphere at Dogpound that’s unlike any other gym I’ve been a part of before. I think it’s because Dogpound isn’t class-oriented. There are tons of people who love their Soulcycles, Barry’s, Flywheels - all of that. Then there are folks who are into what Equinox and David Barton represent - but to me those are gyms that just have really specific aesthetic leanings. When you’re at Dogpound, you have to work out with somebody. It’s the same group of trainers all the time at the one location, so there’s essentially this built-in sense of camaraderie the moment you step in. It’s hard to describe, but it feels like being part of a very specific club. it’s also just a great place to meet people and they open really early, too, which is always helpful for me. \n\n![Jeremy Argyle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ryan%20Serhant%20Jeremy%20Argyle.jpg)\n## Jeremy Argyle\nI met the owner of Jeremy Argyle, Brian Guttman, several years ago through my best friend Caleb Petersen, who is a commercial retail broker. He introduced me to Brian because he’d helped them with that lease and a few other spaces, as well. I just kind of fell in love with their product. And it’s all very simple, right? You can buy shirts anywhere, both online and off; at big businesses and small ones. But the shirts at Jeremy Argyle are very customized - they pay attention to all the details, and they feel better and fit better than any shirt I’ve ever worn. For me, that makes all the difference because I have to wear a button-down shirt to work every day. \n\nYou also have to consider how long they’ve been in the neighborhood, considering how insane Soho leases are. To have a store in the middle of Soho is no easy thing. It’s a testament to the quality of their product and brand. Obviously, because the vast majority of what they sell is shirts, if that wasn’t working for them they’d have been phased out years ago. \n\n![The Serhant Team](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ryan%20Serhant%20The%20Serhant%20Team.jpg)\n## The Serhant Team\nRecently, we had the opening party for my team’s new office in Bed Stuy. Nest Seekers is the brokerage I work for - they’re the umbrella. Then I have agents working under me to help handle my business. My main office is in Soho, but because we’ve been so active in Brooklyn (specifically Bed Stuy and Bushwick) over the past year, I finally pushed to open a location here. Some of that was driven by the fact that there wasn’t already a Nest Seekers location (or an office for any major, reputable brokerage, really) in the neighborhood - but it was also unfair to ask my team to constantly go back and forth between Bed Stuy and Soho every day. \n\nSo, yeah, we opened up this office and are having a lot of fun with it. My friend, Taylor Spellman, who is an incredible interior designer with her own Bravo show on the way, totally decked out the space for us. One of the bathrooms, for instance, is lined with all of our sold listings - we’ll just keep adding to that over the years. The other one has this crazy wallpaper with pinup girls, sharks, and machine guns all over it. Obviously. \n\nAt the end of the day, we’re a small business, as well. It’s a commissions-based brokerage for townhouses, condos, and multi-family properties. We’re growing with the neighborhood.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nBecause independent businesses are the lifeblood of the United States. Without them, larger businesses simply can’t exist. And then you’d never have the reciprocal relationship where corporations and smaller businesses influence each other in a constructive way.\n\nThat’s the theory our economy is built on, right? Ideally, small businesses grow into larger ones, which then allows for other entrepreneurs to plant themselves and seize on new opportunities to be creative. And it’s so important to support the latter because they’re not encumbered in the same way that corporations are - they’re not beholden to hierarchy, bureaucracy, or shareholders. As such, they have the ability to do interesting, riskier things and bring new ideas to the table. \n\nAlso -  I’ll often find that the quality, service, and product offered by independent businesses is simply better than the alternative. I’d argue that’s largely because they have a reputation to build, as opposed to just having one to uphold. So whether you’re making shirts, training people at your gym, or doing what I do, independent businesses provide customers with experiences that you can’t get anywhere else.\n\n_Photographs by Dorothy Hong_\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ryan%20Serhant%20Dogpound.jpg\" alt=\"The Dogpound\"><h2 id=\"the-dogpound\">The Dogpound</h2>\n<p>The Dogpound is significant to me for two reasons - one, being completely honest - it’s the location: they’re right across the street from where I live.

At the time, I didn’t even know what doubles were but he swore A&A was the best in Brooklyn. It’s an odd “sandwich” of curried chickpeas inside fried bread, with tamarind, apple, and mango sauces, and hot pepper. I’ve never bothered comparing because once I had A&A, I couldn’t imagine anyone doing it better. I always hit it on the earlier side of lunch, because it’s not uncommon to roll through in the afternoon and find all the doubles already sold out. I’ve come to understand that’s because it’s traditionally eaten for breakfast in Trinidad. The owner, Geeta Brown, is sweet but all about her bidness since they do such crazy volume. For me, A&A is the quintessential small business. They’ve cornered the niche with high quality product and service, and I’ll be eating those doubles as long as they’re serving.\n\n![Al's Men Shop](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Andre%20Torres%20Al's%20Men%20Shop.jpg)\n## Al's Men Shop\nI’m a hat guy; it’s a rare occasion that I’m not wearing one. But I’m not so much a fitted kinda dude as much as a wide-brimmed fedora kinda dude. I stumbled on Al’s because they were next door to a Goodwill that always had a gang of vinyl. That Goodwill was torn down a few months ago, but Al’s is still going strong after over fifty years in business. They’ve got an insane range of hats from Kangol to Bailey, and I can imagine Al’s being a fave among pimps back in the day. I’ve brought everyone from young bucks to my pops here, so Al’s is on point no matter what you’re looking for. I’m always impressed how the guys there can tell your size by just by looking at your head. Styles have come and gone, but Al’s is forever.\n\n![Charlie’s Calypso City](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Andre%20Torres%20Charlie's%20Calypso%20City.jpg)\n## Charlie’s Calypso City\nCharlie’s has been around for over forty years, and from the looks of it they haven’t changed a thing. The old-school sign out front and steady stock of vintage vinyl makes it feel like you’re stepping into a time machine. While you’re not going to find a copy of that rare funk record you’ve been looking for, you’ll come up on a dope ’80’s dancehall 12” you’ve never seen before. That’s the type of music discovery you can’t get from an algorithm. Charlie’s also houses a recording studio upstairs, and has given lots of local artists their first shot. A real staple of the community, it’s the kind of spot you take for granted and assume will be there forever. But I always remind myself that I thought that same thing about dozens of other joints that have fallen by the wayside in our disappearing New York. Places like Charlie’s are the reason I moved to Brooklyn in the first place, that’s why I cherish them now and support as much as I can. I’d hate to see all of that history erased just because some idiot developer thinks we need another overpriced condo in the hood.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIndependent business is the cornerstone of our economy. No matter how large a company gets, it all starts locally with the mom and pop spot. Nike and Apple may be billion dollar multinationals, but they both started in small garages with big dreams. After running my own company for fifteen years, I empathize with other indie business owners—especially black business owners. I know their struggle first hand, so I appreciate the spots that can weather the storm and consistently deliver the goods. I’m always amazed when I see a small indie business that’s been around for decades still going strong. America’s tried to convince everyone that you’re nothing unless you’re bigger and better than the next guy, but I like indie businesses that know their lane and stay in it. They’re content just doing what they love, and serve as a constant and humbling reminder of why I’m on this planet in the first place.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Andre%20Torres%20A&amp;A%20Bake%20and%20Doubles%20Shop.jpg\" alt=\"A&amp;A Bake &amp; Doubles Shop\"><h2 id=\"a-a-bake-doubles-shop\">A&amp;A Bake &amp; Doubles Shop</h2>\n<p>I’ve been coming to A&amp;A for a few years after getting turned onto it by LargeUp.com founder Jesse Serwer.

I feel like I'm somewhere special whenever I walk in there. The cafe is a partnership, and I love that it supports the community of (futbol) league players (and enthusiasts) in a tiny, but really beautiful cafe, looking out on the soccer fields across Forsyth. Their menu of smoothies is really original, and I appreciate that each takes time to make - they have like 10 things in every drink including several house-made ingredients.\n\n![CW Pencil Enterprises](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Anna%20Sheffield%20CW%20Pencil%20Enterprises.jpg)\n## CW Pencil Enterprises\n\nLiterally next door to the Football Cafe is one of the nicest little surprises in the whole city- CW Pencil Enterprises. This is a place for those who fan out over all things OG - as in original gangster - or more aptly, the version of something that has almost been rendered obsolete, like this glorious writing utensil. I truly have a deep love for such artifacts and, believe it or not, I still draw all of my designs in pencil.

I feel like I&#39;m somewhere special whenever I walk in there. The cafe is a partnership, and I love that it supports the community of (futbol) league players (and enthusiasts) in a tiny, but really beautiful cafe, looking out on the soccer fields across Forsyth. Their menu of smoothies is really original, and I appreciate that each takes time to make - they have like 10 things in every drink including several house-made ingredients.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Anna%20Sheffield%20CW%20Pencil%20Enterprises.jpg\" alt=\"CW Pencil Enterprises\"><h2 id=\"cw-pencil-enterprises\">CW Pencil Enterprises</h2>\n<p>Literally next door to the Football Cafe is one of the nicest little surprises in the whole city- CW Pencil Enterprises. This is a place for those who fan out over all things OG - as in original gangster - or more aptly, the version of something that has almost been rendered obsolete, like this glorious writing utensil. I truly have a deep love for such artifacts and, believe it or not, I still draw all of my designs in pencil.

What he was able to do with the location was crazy. Backing East Village Radio right next door and engaging an entirely new, much wider audience with that - that was just awesome to watch. It’s hard enough running one thing, so it’s really inspiring when you see people engaging customers with stuff that, at face value, might have nothing to do with their main business. The station is how we met the Chances With Wolves guys and the rest of that crew. Lil Frankie’s is a spot that’s always been a stable, reliable neighborhood constant. You know exactly what you’re going to get every single time. \n\n## Lovely Day\nM: When I first moved to New York, one of the first places anyone ever took me to was Lovely Day. Actually, my first group of friends in the city were all people who, at the time, were working at Lovely Day. If we weren’t there for dinner, we’d show up after hours, smoke cigarettes inside, have some drinks, and then go out. Everyone’s obviously grown up and moved on with their lives since those days, but Lovely Day was such a great (and really important) starting off point in the city for me. It’s definitely gotten way more popular since, but at the same time everything else about it has remained consistent over the years. That’s something I appreciate tremendously, because it means you’ll always run into people you know whenever you go by...Lovely Day is home for me in a lot of ways. I really respect Kazusa for that - she’s put so much into her business and protected it for so long.  \n\n## UNIS \nM: I met Eunice right after I met Colin - this was as soon as I’d moved to New York ten years ago. At the time, Colin was living in an apartment that was pretty much adjacent to Eunice’s. It was practically them in the same space. So yeah, man, over the past ten years we’ve had such great times with Eunice (both as a person and as a business owner). Seeing her work so hard on her incredible clothing label, build it into what it is today with this tiny crew of people - it’s been cool to watch the brand advance and get glimpses into her process. We’ve learned a great deal from her. \n\nC: Another thing about Eunice is how much she cares about her neighborhood, the block she lives, on, and small businesses. That’s her heart and, of course, all of it is reflected in her brand. She’s super invested in maintaining the foundations of her community - recently, she got us (and a lot of other cool small businesses) involved with a local charity effort. She was also a huge champion of protecting the Elizabeth St. Garden. I think her customer base for UNIS is as tight-knit and solid as it is because her values are so clearly present across the brand.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nC: Because it’s so hard, dude. They need the help! Whether you like it or not, independent businesses are where new, great ideas are generated. Then they grow from there and are ultimately snatched up and co-opted by big corporations. So yeah, you should support independent businesses because otherwise there’s nothing for big ones to sustain themselves with. That’s kind of a dark way of looking at it, I guess. \n\nM: Big businesses, small ones - they all exist together in an ecosystem. But independent businesses are where originality, individuality, and great ideas come from. By supporting them, you’re demonstrating that you care about all of that. I wish more people like landlords and the IRS cared the same way.\n\nC: My big problem is, whenever I find a small, awesome, local spot, I want to never say anything about it because that’s how they become tourist traps. At the same time, I’m well aware that these businesses need the publicity if they’re going to survive. So if anyone’s figured out how to balance that, please let me know.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"lil-frankie-s\">Lil Frankie’s</h2>\n<p>C: I mean, Frankie is a character - he’s been around forever, and of course the food is fucking amazing.

I remember us campaigning for Punjabi Deli to get a taxi stand placed out front and to get construction sped up so it could stay open. Kabab King kind of runs with the same concept - cheap, good food and tea for cab drivers who work long hours. There’s nothing cool or trendy about it - the decor isn’t anything to marvel at. But a lot of upscale, fancier places lack the soul you get from a good comfort food spot, and Kabab King definitely has that. It’s also the only place where i can get paan - you know, with the betel leaf - so whenever I’m in Jackson Heights I gotta stop by there, grab some paan for my parents, grab some kabab, say hi to all the uncles, and keep it moving. You walk in, you go, “hi uncle!” and they go “who the fuck is this kid? Eat your kabab and get out of here.” But that’s what you want, right? You need to get checked. You can’t stay checking yourself. Your parents stay doing that steady but sometimes you need an uncle to check you. Kind of like when you’re trying to bond with a cabbie and he goes, “just speak English, asshole.” \n\n![Patel Brothers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Heems%20Patel%20Brothers.jpg)\n## Patel Brothers\nYeah, man. Patel Brothers is just your standard grocery stuff. We don’t really fuck with Stop n Shop or anything like that. It’s all Patel Brothers, Maharaja Grocery, Subzi Mandi, and Apna Bazaar - those are the four staples out in Queens and Long Island. They’re out in Bellerose, where I grew up, in Flushing, where I was born, and so that’s where you go when you want anything from vegetables or mangos when it’s mango season to industrial grade coconut oil. I actually didn’t even know they had that until today. This particular Patel Brothers is cool because it has a weird Whole Foods looking sign outside, but the text underneath the logo says “our food...our culture.” It’s the FUBU of grocery stores. Some other Patel Brothers locations will say like, “FARMER’S MARKET,” as if to be like, “please, white people! Come!” This one is like, hey man, fuck you - this is our shit. \n\n![Indian Sari Palace](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Heems%20Indian%20Sari%20Palace.jpg)\n## Indian Sari Palace\nISP. That’s the fabric spot. What people don’t realize is that saris are straight fabrics. If you open my mom’s closet you’ll see yards and yards of fabric bought off the roll. When my parents first came here, there weren’t a lot of places where you could buy Indian stuff. So if you were looking for groceries? Jackson Heights. You needed a sari for a wedding? Jackson Heights. Gold jewelry for the in-laws? Jackson Heights. As more Indian people have done the run from Flushing, Jackson Heights, to Bellerose, to Hicksville, to New Hyde Park, more and more spots have opened up for the community so you don’t have to come around here as much. But that doesn’t take away from Jackson Heights being first. It was the spot where you’d bring relatives visiting from India; even if they were coming to see Times Square, they’d also want to see the Indian market, you know? I remember visiting France with my family back in the day - all we ate at were Indian restaurants. I was like, “yo, I didn’t come to France to eat Indian food,” but looking back on it as an adult, that was kind of an incredible way to see Europe. You got to talk to the waiters and ask how they got there, when they got there, how many of us are there in Paris, and so on. Anyways, Jackson Heights has that same identity complex that I relate to, so it’s always felt most like home to me.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nI’m an independent musician, so I relate in a lot of ways to what independent business owners go through. I feel like, as Jackson Heights changes, we will eventually see a Whole Foods here. A lot of family spots will be shut down when a Duane Reade opens up. I don’t want that to happen - not on some ultra-protective shit, but just because it fundamentally changes the backbone of the neighborhood. All we got is this one street - 74th street - and if we don’t support what we have, it’ll just become what Williamsburg has turned into. \n\nNone of this is to say that I have more of a claim on anything than anyone else - New York is fundamentally about change. Gentrification probably will find its way to Jackson Heights in the not too distant future. But I want that balance. If I ever moved here, it wouldn’t be because of convenience or proximity to the city, it’d be because I treasure the nostalgia that Jackson Heights evokes for me. I’d never want it to lose that nostalgic quality. These businesses are run by families just like mine. We call small businesses the backbone of the economy, but they’re equally backbones of culture as well. That’s why maintaining them is so important to me.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Heems%20Kabab%20King.jpg\" alt=\"Kabab King\"><h2 id=\"kabab-king\">Kabab King</h2>\n<p>Kabab King reminds me of somewhere like Punjabi Deli in the city.

They take the time the time to greet the customers and chat about what&#39;s going on in their lives. It&#39;s the best way for anyone to start a morning, really.</p>","date":"2016-07-07 15:02 -0400","published":true,"title":"Bettina Chin Cho","description":"legal counsel, special projects manager, show producer - <a href=\"https://www.openingceremony.com/\">Opening Ceremony</a>","category":"favorites","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/bettina_chin_cho_new_main.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Bettina Chin Cho","socialBlurb":"Bettina Chin Cho shares three of her favorite local businesses in NYC.

Scott, the owner at the time, didn’t need my services and (correctly) felt that it was a privilege for me to be working for him. I remember his directive to me was “I want signs that look like the South Bronx meets the West Village.” Who thinks of life in those terms? Scott did, and he was a really great person to have as a boss and muse - anyone who has their business thought out to that point deserves all the help they can get. The first couple of signs I painted for Scott (and I was working for free, mind you) - he thought they were terrible. I tried to argue with him but he stopped me and goes, “nah nah nah, I have bolts in my bumper cars that have to be torqued to thirty three newtons per square meter, none of this pounds per inches shit - don’t tell me what perfection looks like. I’ll come out here and paint these signs and next year you’ll see what perfection looks like.” This guy had probably never held a brush in his life, but he knew that, in his mind, if he could perceive perfection he could achieve perfection.

That’s what the operation was like for the first decade. He finally switched over to a digital camera set-up not too long ago. My son and I have been getting a “HOMIES FOREVER” banner here since he was six months old. The funny thing is, though, Michael ran out of “HOMIES FOREVER” blanks like five years back. Fortunately, I was able to find a stash online so hopefully that’ll last us until my son hits adulthood (or he gets tired of this escapade). But that’s it, you know? I’m tied in to Michael’s Photo Studio for the next, say, twelve years.

They’re the real texture of New York. If you’re complaining about New York changing and how it’s not this or that anymore - everything that you want from New York lives on in local businesses. If you don’t support them, you have nothing to whine about when they disappear.

When I came to New York a couple of months after launching The WW Club in LA, I contacted Sabrina and Alissa via a mutual friend to ask if they'd speak on my first panel event in NYC.

New York is also the place that I formed my own independent business, The WW Club. Through my own experiences and by sharing those of other women doing the same thing, I've learnt that running a business is no joke! Especially in a city as competitive and expensive as New York.

Eight years older than me and as wise as they come, she’s taught me so much about life, love, creativity, passion, empathy, justice, and vulnerability. She put me on to so much music as a kid, ranging from Nas to The Circle Jerks. She helped me escape the destructive boredom that children growing up in dying southern towns easily fall prey to. The list goes on forever, but the point is that Anna is an incredible human and I am inspired by her every day. Her storefront on Orchard Street is a perfect example of her vision manifested in a physical setting. It showcases everything from her amazing sense of layout and merchandising to her ability to make a space feel personal and intimate. \n\n![Lighthouse](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Kevin%20Kearney%20The%20Lighthouse.jpg)\n## Lighthouse\nI have been going to Lighthouse for years now - it's right around the corner from my house in Brooklyn. As a former cook who mercilessly judged every diner who made me prepare them chicken, I suddenly find myself ordering chicken nearly every time I’m here. My friend Joey Scalabrino took over as chef fairly recently is largely to blame; his creations are some of the best dishes you can get in the neighborhood, no contest. At only 25 years old, Joey is passionate, full of ideas and driven by the kind of work ethic that separates great artists from good ones. Additionally, the owners of the Lighthouse, a lovely Israeli brother and sister duo, have brought their homeland's influence to Joey’s repertoire while giving him the freedom to bring everything to life in a contemporary way. \n\n![The Meat Hook](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Kevin%20Kearney%20The%20Meathook.jpg)\n## The Meat Hook\nAs a former butcher and avid meat cook, all I can say is that I love this place so much. I guess I’m almost  genetically programmed to feel this way - both of my grandfathers and my great-grandpa were butchers who owned their own shops. Meat Hook's new location offers its customers a more focused, easy-to-shop selection of aged meats, organic produce, and other brilliantly curated grocery items. I recommend the aged porterhouse, the tomahawk ribeye, their whole aged strip loin, and anything lamb that they have on hand. The staff is super nice and helpful, and most of them have a strong knowledge of meat cookery. This tends to make more adventurous purchases less daunting, as you can gain some insights into how it should be prepared before taking the plunge. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIt's important to support small businesses because they make up the backbone of American creativity and our economy. In order to function as communities, it’s essential that we maintain personal relationships with the companies we do business with. That’s something most large, multinational corporations simply cannot provide in the same capacity.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Kevin%20Kearney%20Anna%20Sheffield.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Sheffield&#39;s Orchard Street Atelier\"><h2 id=\"anna-sheffield-s-orchard-street-atelier\">Anna Sheffield&#39;s Orchard Street Atelier</h2>\n<p>Not only is Anna one of the most creative people I know, she is also my big sister and business partner.

The staff who work there are great. I get pretty anxious about stepping into any beauty place, whether it be a hair salon, manicurist or whatever else.

Neighborhoods that are overrun by corporate establishments - Williamsburg being a prime example in New York - become havens for wealthy, predominantly white, heterosexual families that push everyone else out. The byproduct of this action is that it kills any culture that was originally there. So, if independently owned businesses get pushed out of a neighborhood, people who live in or visit them end up becoming the audience to a show you never signed up to see: Heteronormativity, Gentrification, Privilege, and Whiteness (The Musical, lol).\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Frankie%20Hutchinson%20Bossa%20Nova%20Civic%20Club.jpg\" alt=\"Bossa Nova Civic Club\"><h2 id=\"bossa-nova-civic-club\">Bossa Nova Civic Club</h2>\n<p>We threw our first ever Discwoman party at Bossa.

So, if independently owned businesses get pushed out of a neighborhood, people who live in or visit them end up becoming the audience to a show you never signed up to see: Heteronormativity, Gentrification, Privilege, and Whiteness (The Musical, lol).</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-07-27 11:09 -0400","published":true,"title":"Frankie Hutchinson","description":"co-founder - <a href=\"http://www.discwoman.com/\">Discwoman</a>","fbTitle":"For New York: Frankie Hutchinson","socialBlurb":"Discwoman co-fdouner Frankie Hutchinson shares three of her favorite local businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@DISCWOMANNYC co-founder @FrankieFatGold shares her 3 favorite businesses in NYC","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Frankie%20Hutchinson%20Main%20Portrait.jpg"},{"name":"angie-martinez","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-09-01 09:48 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Angie Martinez\ndescription: >-\n  <a href=\"http://power1051.iheart.com/onair/angie-martinez-54909/\">radio\n  personality</a>, <a\n  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/My-Voice-Memoir-Angie-Martinez/dp/1101990333\">best-selling\n  author</a>\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/angie_martinez_portrait_960.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Angie Martinez '\nsocialBlurb: >-\n  Radio personality and best selling author Angie Martinez shares her 3 favorite\n  independent businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: .@angiemartinez shares her 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.\n---\n## Stadium Goods\nI’ve always been a complete nutcase about sneakers, and somehow I managed to birth a sneakerhead who, at this point, has completely exceeded my obsession with them. So, whenever he does something amazing, going to Stadium Goods is the reward - that’s the prize. The cool thing about Stadium Goods is you’re walking in there thinking, “what can we find today?” It’s not like you’re going in there with expectations - that makes the whole experience so much more interesting. Additionally, this guy outgrows sneakers every 30 days so it’s also a good place to unload some of those. He’s at that age. It’s always interesting to see what he chooses versus what I pick out for myself.\n\nThe other thing is,  while I do know the owners really well, Stadium Goods is a cool enough experience that we’ll stop by whether they’re there or not. I love it. It’s near the station, too, so the convenience helps.\n\n## Añejo\nMan, Añejo. I fell in love with that place at their first location on the west side in the 40s. The first time I was there was because I had a meeting with one of the guys - the head chef - and then I just kept going back! By myself, with my family, my friends...Añejo feels like a local bar but the food and drinks are just a step up. The vibes were good, the music was good - I don’t know, I’m sitting there drinking a jalapeño margarita, listening to Marc Anthony, eating guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it - it’s all hitting. \n\nSo, I wind up becoming friends with the guy and end up doing a book with him later, so when he opened the Tribeca location I kind of jumped in on that one. I’m there all the time. I’ll go with my peoples or we’ll do staff parties in there, all of that. And they have lockers on site, too, right? So you can buy a bottle of something and if you don’t finish it, they’ll put it in your locker for whenever you come back. What more could you ask for? \n\n## Brooklyn Wax Company\nBrooklyn Wax Company makes these candles - oh my god, they’re so damn cute. I have seven of them at home but you’ll notice I don’t have any here at the station because people steal. I’m surrounded by thieves. I’m kidding. But my candles do tend to mysteriously disappear. \n\nI don’t know how they do it, but they’ll slice a bottle of, say, Hennessy or anything else, really, and fill it up with an amazing scented candle. So they make really great, personal gifts, especially for the people in your life who have everything. You can just take their favorite bottle, hopefully empty, and turn it into something that means a lot to them. I have a few Ace of Spades bottles (because my name starts with an A) that I’ve had them make candles out of. Plus, they let you pick the scent out. Brooklyn Wax Company. Perfect.\n\n## Bonus: The Butcher’s Daughter\nFirst of all, how great of a name is that for a place that doesn’t serve anything from the butcher? It’s the greatest thing ever. They have these spicy kale salads that I’m absolutely obsessed with. These things are perfect for any day after I have those spicy margaritas at Añejo and I feel like I need to eat a little better. They have an avocado toast that I like and their juice game is nice, but that kale salad...if I’m in the mood for that, nothing else will satisfy that craving. It’s an incredible salad. I’ll go through phases where I’m eating something from the Butcher’s Daughter every day of the month. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nThat’s how you keep control of everything. That’s how you keep it true to how things are supposed to be. A sneaker store, for instance, you want to make sure that the person running that shop is really about that life, that he or she gets the culture. That’s not to say that a big retailer can’t merchandise a sneaker the right way, but with small businesses you get that personality, you get to support something that goes back into your community. You help the people around you. There’s a feeling of shared responsibility and ownership when you support an independent business. \n\nAlso, when something is smaller and privately owned, people tend to put so much more into it. Because it’s their life, right? If they don’t care about it, who else will? So you get those guarantees, as well.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"stadium-goods\">Stadium Goods</h2>\n<p>I’ve always been a complete nutcase about sneakers, and somehow I managed to birth a sneakerhead who, at this point, has completely exceeded my obsession with them.

They've created a wonderful space, with an attention to detail I truly appreciate (the floors!) and a beautiful selection of home goods. I admire their aesthetic and strong support for local makers. We often run into each other with our families as we work and live in the same neighborhood. \n\n![Frankling Pizza](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Re%20Jin%20Lee%20Franklin%20Pizza.jpg)\n## Franklin Pizza \nI'm so grateful this one is close to my studio.

Though I enjoy the fancy thin crusted pizzas once in a while, there's nothing like a normal, down to earth slice of pizza.\n\n![Brooklyn Barge](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Re%20Jin%20Lee%20BK%20Barge.jpg)\n## Brooklyn Barge\nWe have an amazing view of the East River and Manhattan from my studio window. One thing I appreciate the most is the breeze that keeps us refreshed during warm days and with it the scent of salt water that reminds me of the beach life growing up in Brazil. That leads me to going down to the Barge (which is right next door) as it reminds me of the food & drinks \"quiosques\" (kiosks in Portuguese) on the Brazilian beaches. There's nothing more comforting to me than the smell of food (especially fried) and freshly squeezed lime mixed in with the scent of salt water. The river is no beach, and the barge is not a 'quiosque', of course, but I appreciate it as what it is; a great local place to enjoy a drink, the breeze and a good conversation whilst floating on water and looking out into the beautiful NYC skyline.\n\n## Why is it important so support independent businesses?\nFrom an independent business you will receive the fruit of their passion.

It’s an unassuming karaoke spot on the border of Chinatown and Tribeca, an area that’s not particularly known for having anything interesting to do at night. What this tells me is that everyone who comes here is committed to being there precisely because it’s not the kind of spot one wanders into. There’s a few perks to this place—for example, it’s $70 an hour for a private room, but the package comes with $70 worth of free drinks. That’s great and well-appreciated, but here’s the real reason why you should be at BINY: this place has the most extensive catalogue of deep cuts I’ve ever seen. The song selection is incredible. One of my favorite things about karaoke is that if you do it right, it ends up not being about selecting the song that you feel like singing at that particular moment; instead, it’s about choosing the song that’s going to make everyone in the room go wild. There are very few things in life that bring the same rush of emotions as following up your friend’s ironic choice of 90’s Nu-metal hit “It’s Been a While” by Staind with “Toot It and Boot It” only to have that weird dude who tagged along with your friend jump in with “Defying Gravity” from the musical Wicked and everyone in the room throws their arm up in disgust and looks at him sideways. Except that scenario never happened and I was the one who lined up all three of those songs in row.\n\n![Larry Lawrence](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Eric%20Hu%20Larry%20Lawrence.jpg) \n## Larry Lawrence\nA bar modeled after a speakeasy located in Williamsburg. While that technically describes what Larry Lawrence is, the experience here has almost nothing to do with what it sounds like on paper. I’ve been a regular patron at this place for nearly four years and the place has been around for much longer than that. The hidden entrance and the glass-encased smoking section is where the speakeasy comparison stops. It doesn’t have any of the insufferable period-style caricature and general insincerity establishments of that nature usually bring with them. The drinks are well-priced, the bartenders are down to earth and all of them are sweethearts. Here, you’re getting served by someone sporting a tank top and not a handlebar mustache. If you’ve been to Larry Lawrence more than once they probably know your name. Ook Seo, the owner (and one of the most interesting people I have ever met), named this place after a childhood friend. There’s something really nice about that. So many bars have come and go or have been irreparably changed for the worse by the transitions of their host neighborhoods, with Williamsburg being the prime example of this. That said, LL has remained consistent and has always treated me solid. It’s gotten busier on Saturday nights as of late, but catch it during the off-peak hours or a weeknight and it feels like home. It’s where I would take a friend who I haven’t seen in years if I really wanted to catch up with them. If I start the night at Larry Lawrence, I probably won’t be inclined to go elsewhere. If I end the night at Larry Lawrence, I’ll go to bed content with how the evening wound down.\n\n![Thriving Steam Pot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Eric%20Hu%20Thriving%20Steam%20Pot.jpg)\n## Thriving Steam Pot\nThis place is a relative newcomer to Flushing’s ever-evolving culinary scene, but it’s a game-changer as far as I’m concerned. My dad suggested this place for a late lunch a few months ago. He was running late and told me to order for him but when I got there, it took me a while to understand the restaurant’s concept - hot pot without the broth. Sounds weird but it works unbelievably well. So well, in fact, that it may turn you away from regular hot pot forever. Everything is steamed. Here’s how it works, there’s a hole in the middle of your table where a bowl of rice grains sits. It’s filled with water and covered at the top with a metal grill. While the whole thing is steamed, your food at the top is being cooked. When you’re done, the lid is removed to reveal the congee that had been slow-cooking since you sat down. While it’s definitely a healthier alternative to hot pot, the taste is ultimately what makes it appealing. Shellfish is the secret weapon at Thriving. Clams, abalone, mussels and crab cook on the shell so all the juiciness and flavor remains intact. High-quality ingredients retain their integrity and taste with this method because they aren’t overpowered from sitting in a vat of boiling, spicy liquid. That’s also the reason you don’t end up feeling lethargic after your meal. The congee at the end rounds out the meal beautifully as it’s taken on subtle hints of flavors from everything else you ate that night. I honestly hope this method of cooking gets emulated everywhere.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nMore than ever, it’s imperative that we continue to patronize independent businesses that we’re fond of. The internet as we know it has largely dissolved the line between underground and mainstream in many industries. The most obvious example that comes to mind is music—today, songs from independent and mainstream record labels can be accessed via the same channels. We often talk about how the playing field has been leveled but it’s a double-edged sword. Just as smaller labels appear bigger, larger labels can appear smaller. As our online lives begin to creep into real and physical spaces, this is going to be even more apparent in other industries as well. It’s becoming too easy for us to take access to products and content for granted as values such as convenience and speed position themselves as the main barometers of innovation. Visiting your favorite small bookstore, seeing a title you like, and taking your phone out to see if it’s cheaper on Amazon has become a tragic cliché at this point. What gives a person who does that the right to complain about their favorite spots closing? Our increasingly algorithm-driven values and perspectives make it easy to forget that independent shops rely on our dollars in a much more real and existential way...if they go under, that’s it. For everyone who is intimidated by politics, supporting small businesses with your money is a very real political act that has meaningful impact on society. And in a city like New York, with all of its amazing independent businesses, it’s a fairly easy choice to make.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Eric%20Hu%20Biny.jpg\" alt=\"BINY\"><h2 id=\"biny\">BINY</h2>\n<p>My friend Julia put me on to BINY.

And in a city like New York, with all of its amazing independent businesses, it’s a fairly easy choice to make.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-07-18 10:25 -0400","published":true,"title":"Eric Hu","description":"director of design - <a href=\"https://www.ssense.com/\">SSENSE</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Eric%20Hu%20main%20portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Eric Hu ","socialBlurb":"SSENSE design director Eric Hu shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@SSENSE director of design @_EricHu shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC with @onbondstreet"},{"name":"jubilee","markdown":"---\ntitle: Jubilee\ndescription: 'DJ, Producer - <a href=\"http://www.mixpakrecords.com/\">Mixpak</a>'\ncategory: favorites\ndate: 'Mon Jun 13 2016 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JubileeMainPortrait.jpg'\npublished: true\ntweetText: >-\n  .@JubileeDJ of @Mixpak shares three of her favorite local businesses in NYC\n  with @onbondstreet \nsocialBlurb: Jubilee of Mixpak shares three of her favorite local businesses in NYC.\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Jubilee'\n---\n\n![Hudson Market Place](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JubileeHudsonMarketPlace.jpg)\n\n## Hudson Market Place\n\nIf you live in New York your corner store is incredibly important to you. Those guys are practically in your family if you’re a real New Yorker. They see everyone you bring in and out of your house and every condition you’ve been in, whether you’re tired and feel like shit or you look great heading somewhere. I support my guys because they work all hours seven days a week and go through a lot to live in New York - all while sending money back home to their families. On top of that, they have to work for their dad who probably yells at them nonstop every day even though they’re adults. So, they deserve the support!\n\n![Stile’s Farmers Market](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JubileeStilesFarmersMarket.jpg)\n\n## Stile’s Farmers Market\n\nGrocery shopping in New York is sort of bullshit. You have to go to eight different places to find meat, produce, and whatever else unless you’re willing to pay for crazy markups at Whole Foods or wherever. I support Stile’s because they never overcharge you, the same crew is always there, and everyone clearly works really hard. Regular, normally priced vegetables - what a concept. I can fill up my fridge with fruits and vegetables from Stile’s for like $17 to $24. That said, I totally thought Stile’s was a giant dumpster in a sort of abandoned parking lot the first few times I walked past it.\n\n![Broadway Dance](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JubileeBroadwayDance.jpg)\n\n## Broadway Dance\n\nI like Broadway Dance because you don’t have to commit - you can just drop in and take a class whenever you feel like it. I’ve been going there since I first moved to New York - the membership is like $20 a year. Where else can you get vogue classes from actual voguers, house classes from actual old house heads...I think there’s even a club class where you can wear heels. True New York shit. There’s a really sick dancehall class that is the hardest thing you’ll ever do.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nBecause they keep your city alive. Independent business owners care about you and you should care about them. Staying local is almost always better for your city. You don’t get real interactions with anyone when you go to a big chain store or restaurant - I feel like that can easily trickle down to how neighbors and people who live in a community talk to each other. Also, everyone our age is starting to realize that you should be working for yourself and not some middle management asshole who doesn’t care about you. So if we’re all trying to start our own businesses, it’s even more important that we look out for each other.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JubileeHudsonMarketPlace.jpg\" alt=\"Hudson Market Place\"><h2 id=\"hudson-market-place\">Hudson Market Place</h2>\n<p>If you live in New York your corner store is incredibly important to you.

But then, the idea of Stadium Goods was brought to me by my friends John and Jed. When they explained the concept to me, I knew I had to jump onboard. The elevated approach they were bringing to consignment, the hospitality angle, the customer-first philosophy - it all made me go, “oh my god, you have to please let me in. I’ll offer up any of my lowly talents if you let me in.” They obviously wanted me in the mix, somehow, but I insisted and practically begged to be involved at the highest level possible.\n\nSo, SG is just a really cool spot with a great team behind it. As a lifelong collector, I love seeing how all of the gear and sneakers are presented to people who come in. We try to make sure that the staff is as welcoming and as helpful as possible - more often than not, with sneaker and streetwear stores, you don’t really get that. At the end of the day, though, Stadium Goods is where I get to hang out with my friends - why wouldn’t we want customers to feel the same way? \n\nIt’s a relief that I finally have a place that’s not my office where I can tell people to swing by, especially if they’re visiting from out of town. SG is ultimately a nice gathering place, which is what I think good independent businesses tend to be for their communities. To say that I’m extremely proud of Stadium Goods would be an understatement. I feel like I’m finally doing exactly what I wanted to be doing for a long time.\n\n![Kam Hing Coffee Shop](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Yu-Ming%20Wu%20Kam%20Hing%20Coffee%20Shop.jpg)\n## Kam Hing Coffee Shop\nKam Hing is an old school spot that’s been around forever. It’s a coffee shop that’s renowned for its sponge cakes. One of my earliest offices was on the Lower East Side, right across the street from Kam Hing. Naturally, it became the team’s go-to spot for coffee, iced tea, snacks, spongecake, wifey cakes, melon cakes, you name it. I forget when it happened, but at some point we realized that the owner’s son, Chris (who plays a big operational role at Kam Hing), was a sneaker guy. So that allowed us to become friendly with each other and, of course, we realized we actually had a lot of friends in common. \n\nLike I said, a nice thing about independent businesses is how they help you expand your circle. Chris has always been great with introducing me to random people who’ve turned out to be great friends and connects. One time, I was grabbing an iced tea and he goes, “Yu-Ming, you gotta meet this guy. He’s the community manager at the 5th Precinct. If Sneakernews ever does events or whatever, you should link up.” At the time, I hadn’t even considered that Sneakernews would ever get into that, so I just filed the guy in the back of my head and kept it moving. Fast forward to 2016 - we have DJ Khaled on the cover of our print magazine and we’re about to do this event at Stadium Goods for the launch. We hadn’t thought it through, but as we started realizing how big Khaled’s presence had gotten, one of his guys got in touch and begged us to be really thorough with security on-site. Things had apparently gotten out of hand in Dallas at an Urban Outfitters event with him or something a few weeks earlier. So, Chris and the 5th Precinct guy come to mind as soon as it dawns on everyone that we have to give the cops fair warning about this thing. I call Chris up, he reconnects us, it turns out that one of the main guys at the 5th is a sneakerhead, and we end up having one of the most positive, smoothly run events in SG’s history. I mean, Howard and Mercer were overflowing with people, but it went off without a hitch. \n\nOh, and the other awesome thing about Kam Hing is that the Mexican guys who work there all speak Cantonese. So you’ll have these grandmas coming in and they’ll order in Chinese and the Mexican guys will keep the conversation going. New York.\n\n![West New Malaysian Restaurant](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Yu-Ming%20Wu%20West%20New%20Malaysian%20Restaurant.jpg)\n## West New Malaysian Restaurant\nSo this spot is right in the middle of the infamous Chinatown tunnel that cuts across Elizabeth and Bowery. Obviously, you don’t get too many tourists or food reviewers in here, which is great. I’ve been coming here since I was 15. And, basically, I just never stopped eating here. I’ll come by at least once a month, probably more. Lunch, dinner. Chinese food is my main thing, but sometimes when I want some kind of outside flavor, New Malaysian has dishes that are close enough to home while bringing the remix. It’s one of my favorite places to eat and certainly the place I’ve been a regular at for the longest. Get the roti and wet-style ho fun with the raw egg on top. Oh, and the Hainan chicken. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nMan, because I know what it is to start and run your own independent business! I started Sneakernews with no external financing. I respect the hustle, I respect people who do what they need to do and work their ass off to make their own way. All of the people who work at every spot I mentioned - these guys service their communities. They give something back; they keep neighborhoods and cultures like Chinatown healthy. If something like McDonald’s or Burger King took this space over I don’t know what I’d do. For me, it’s all about the lowkey joints that are neighborhood icons. Authenticity and hustle - that’s why you should support independent businesses.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Yu-Ming%20Wu%20Stadium%20Goods.jpg\" alt=\"Stadium Goods\"><h2 id=\"stadium-goods\">Stadium Goods</h2>\n<p>For years, people would always ask me if I’d spin up a brick and mortar thing off of Sneakernews or something else, and I’d always say no.

Amazing furniture. Amazing home goods. They have the dopest stuff. \n\nL: The best thing is how clear it all is in there - it’s their point of view and that perspective just happens to be cool as shit. They’re obviously not the only furniture store in the city, but to me they might as well be. The way they express themselves makes Coming Soon so different from anything else. \n\nS: I’d rather drop fifteen hundred on something at Coming Soon than at Design Within Reach any day. Not just because their personality comes through in the selection, but because Helena and Fabiana, they show love all the time. I met them through a friend a while ago and we hit it off while we were starting to build our spot out. Immediately, they were the ones who showed us the most love. I’m not trying to judge no one else on the block, but for being right across the street, they were super genuine with it right away. They were also our first customers as soon as we opened our doors. Anything we needed, they’ve always held us down. So - the way we were raised in the streets - when people show us love, it’s only natural that we reciprocate. \n\nL: They get that sense of community. Like Scarr said, the way we were raised out here, if someone moves into the neighborhood, we’re not going to make it awkward for them. Immediately, it’s “hey, what’s good, how can we help you?” \n\nS: We’re here for you. That’s how it used to be - that’s how New York was. Now, if you try the same thing, 9 out of 10 times people get awkward about it like I’m trying to rob you or something. Everyone has their guard up now.\n\n![La Petite Mort](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Le%20Petite%20Mort.jpg)\n## La Petite Mort\nL: OJ just the local, man. \n\nS: I known OJ a crazy long time, man. The wild part is, him and Los came up in the same neighborhood and they didn’t really know each other until we were all on the same block right here!\n\nL: I would see OJ out at like parties and shit - we grew up all over the LES. LPM is a reflection of that, you know? New York shit. It’s local products, a local concept, run by a very local dude. \n\nS: He might toe the line a little bit when it comes to the hipster shit, but you can’t knock the man’s hustle (laughs). We all gotta eat. \n\nL: LPM is a classic mom and pop spot, man. It’s a perfect reflection of OJ, his point of view, his fashion, and the era he came up in here. It’s genuine as fuck.\n\nS: Especially when you consider where people like OJ and us come from. That makes it extra impressive that he has something of his own. People don’t understand that we grew up with nothing. Literally. I’m not even talking about not having something to inherit from parents or family or whatever, we didn’t even have it in our minds that an investor was something that existed. Straight up. All of us, our money comes from us busting our ass. That’s it. \n\nL: Like Beanie Sigel said, “here is something you can’t understand.”\n\n![Gohan](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Gohan.jpg)\n## Gohan\nS: Gohan is run by a husband and wife duo who I’ve known since they had Lovely Day. This was when I was working at Lombardi’s as a server like twelve years ago. I used to walk by Lovely Day all the time, so I saw the progression from it being empty the first six months to it becoming impossible to get a seat because all the fashion people in New York were there every night. I just used to go in because it was affordable and I love the ginger chicken - \n\nL: - the chicks.\n\nS: Yeah (laughs), there were a lot of girls. A loooooooooooooot of girls. \n\nL: So Gohan is their new spot. It’s a breath of fresh air, to be honest. \n\nS: We have a lot of restaurants, both old and new, in this neighborhood, but few are as good as Gohan. Even fewer - and this is the real beauty of Gohan - are as healthy with everything they serve. It tastes like home cooking. I’ve had a lot of great Japanese food and this place stands apart, completely.\n\nWhat really strikes a chord with me is how family-driven this place is. You see their kid in the back and everyone working the line. That really reminds me of how I grew up. My first job at fifteen was working the counter at the bodega in the worst projects imaginable. Dealing with the worst people ever. Then my next job was at Ballato’s - everyone thinks of Ballato’s as this hot spot now but this was when no one except locals knew about it. And both of these operations, the bodega, Ballato’s, a lot of other places I’ve worked at down here - they’re all family businesses. There’s something really important about that.\n\nL: Keeping it in the family.\n\nS: Exactly.\n \n![Bonus: Goodnight Sonny](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Goodnight%20Sonny.jpg) \n## Bonus: Goodnight Sonny\nL: Goodnight Sonny. Old New York bar. Good quality, high standards, reliable, open til late in the morning - I make a lot of great bad decisions here, usually. They just do everything right, honestly. From the service to the food they cook to the drinks they pour, it’s all available and consistent til 4 in the morning. It’s like having a butler, it’s like my nanny. Always there when I need them.\n\nS: Everyone hypes the fuck out of Blue Ribbon - no offense, I love that sushi - but the bistro, I used to go there a lot and I’ll say that Goodnight Sonny is actually the best place to eat after 2 AM. There’s no other spot like it. This is the late night joint. You gotta wait til all the bros filter out and then come through wild late. Their other spot, The Wayland, is low-key fire, too.  \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nS: I know everyone tells you the same thing, but man, I just want to eat AT a restaurant every once in awhile, you know? Everything is a delivery app, now. That’s not what we’re about. What happened to fuckin’ talking with people who work at your local. \n\nL: Take a walk, you know what I’m saying? I just want to feel like I’m in the hood once in awhile.\n\nS: When you come to our spot, you treat us like family, we treat you like family, that’s it. Simple. It’s no deeper than that. \n\nL: It’s important to look out for each other. \n\nS: Talking about family - I was there when Lenny Kravitz bought Ballato’s their awning. He just bought them an awning because Emilio showed him love. Lenny’s still a regular customer over there. He didn’t have to do that, you know? But that’s what we’re talking about - support each other. Why do you need a reason to do that besides the fact that it’s the right thing to do?\n\nL: We in New York - there’s mad people stacked on top of each other. Spread love. It’s easier to be a decent person than it is to be a shithead.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Coming%20Soon%20NY.jpg\" alt=\"Coming Soon New York\"><h2 id=\"coming-soon-new-york\">Coming Soon New York</h2>\n<p>S: We been friends with the Coming Soon girls since forever.

Everyone has their guard up now.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Le%20Petite%20Mort.jpg\" alt=\"La Petite Mort\"><h2 id=\"la-petite-mort\">La Petite Mort</h2>\n<p>L: OJ just the local, man. </p><p>S: I known OJ a crazy long time, man. The wild part is, him and Los came up in the same neighborhood and they didn’t really know each other until we were all on the same block right here!</p><p>L: I would see OJ out at like parties and shit - we grew up all over the LES. LPM is a reflection of that, you know? New York shit. It’s local products, a local concept, run by a very local dude. </p><p>S: He might toe the line a little bit when it comes to the hipster shit, but you can’t knock the man’s hustle (laughs). We all gotta eat. </p><p>L: LPM is a classic mom and pop spot, man. It’s a perfect reflection of OJ, his point of view, his fashion, and the era he came up in here. It’s genuine as fuck.</p><p>S: Especially when you consider where people like OJ and us come from. That makes it extra impressive that he has something of his own. People don’t understand that we grew up with nothing. Literally. I’m not even talking about not having something to inherit from parents or family or whatever, we didn’t even have it in our minds that an investor was something that existed. Straight up. All of us, our money comes from us busting our ass. That’s it. </p><p>L: Like Beanie Sigel said, “here is something you can’t understand.”</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Gohan.jpg\" alt=\"Gohan\"><h2 id=\"gohan\">Gohan</h2>\n<p>S: Gohan is run by a husband and wife duo who I’ve known since they had Lovely Day. This was when I was working at Lombardi’s as a server like twelve years ago. I used to walk by Lovely Day all the time, so I saw the progression from it being empty the first six months to it becoming impossible to get a seat because all the fashion people in New York were there every night. I just used to go in because it was affordable and I love the ginger chicken - </p><p>L: - the chicks.</p><p>S: Yeah (laughs), there were a lot of girls. A loooooooooooooot of girls. </p><p>L: So Gohan is their new spot. It’s a breath of fresh air, to be honest. </p><p>S: We have a lot of restaurants, both old and new, in this neighborhood, but few are as good as Gohan. Even fewer - and this is the real beauty of Gohan - are as healthy with everything they serve. It tastes like home cooking. I’ve had a lot of great Japanese food and this place stands apart, completely.</p><p>What really strikes a chord with me is how family-driven this place is. You see their kid in the back and everyone working the line. That really reminds me of how I grew up. My first job at fifteen was working the counter at the bodega in the worst projects imaginable. Dealing with the worst people ever. Then my next job was at Ballato’s - everyone thinks of Ballato’s as this hot spot now but this was when no one except locals knew about it. And both of these operations, the bodega, Ballato’s, a lot of other places I’ve worked at down here - they’re all family businesses. There’s something really important about that.</p><p>L: Keeping it in the family.</p><p>S: Exactly.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Goodnight%20Sonny.jpg\" alt=\"Bonus: Goodnight Sonny\"> <h2 id=\"bonus-goodnight-sonny\">Bonus: Goodnight Sonny</h2>\n<p>L: Goodnight Sonny. Old New York bar. Good quality, high standards, reliable, open til late in the morning - I make a lot of great bad decisions here, usually. They just do everything right, honestly. From the service to the food they cook to the drinks they pour, it’s all available and consistent til 4 in the morning. It’s like having a butler, it’s like my nanny. Always there when I need them.</p><p>S: Everyone hypes the fuck out of Blue Ribbon - no offense, I love that sushi - but the bistro, I used to go there a lot and I’ll say that Goodnight Sonny is actually the best place to eat after 2 AM. There’s no other spot like it. This is the late night joint. You gotta wait til all the bros filter out and then come through wild late. Their other spot, The Wayland, is low-key fire, too.  </p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>S: I know everyone tells you the same thing, but man, I just want to eat AT a restaurant every once in awhile, you know? Everything is a delivery app, now. That’s not what we’re about. What happened to fuckin’ talking with people who work at your local. </p><p>L: Take a walk, you know what I’m saying? I just want to feel like I’m in the hood once in awhile.</p><p>S: When you come to our spot, you treat us like family, we treat you like family, that’s it. Simple. It’s no deeper than that. </p><p>L: It’s important to look out for each other. </p><p>S: Talking about family - I was there when Lenny Kravitz bought Ballato’s their awning. He just bought them an awning because Emilio showed him love. Lenny’s still a regular customer over there. He didn’t have to do that, you know? But that’s what we’re talking about - support each other. Why do you need a reason to do that besides the fact that it’s the right thing to do?</p><p>L: We in New York - there’s mad people stacked on top of each other. Spread love. It’s easier to be a decent person than it is to be a shithead.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-10-14 14:02 -0400","published":true,"title":"Scarr and Los Franco","description":"co-founders - <a href=\"http://www.scarrspizza.com/\">Scarr’s Pizza</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Main%20Portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Scarr and Los Franco","socialBlurb":"Scarr and Los Franco of Scarr's Pizza share their 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.","tweetText":"Scarr and Los Franco of Scarr's Pizza share their 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC."},{"name":"tamara-santiba-ez","markdown":"---\ndate: '2016-06-27 09:56 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Tamara Santibañez\ndescription: >-\n  <a href=\"http://tamarasantibanez.com/\">artist</a>, <a\n  href=\"http://tamarasantibanez.com/\">tattoo artist</a>, publisher - <a\n  href=\"http://www.disciplinepress.com/\">Discipline Press</a>\ncategory: favorites\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/ATamara%20Santibanez%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Tamara Santibañez'\nsocialBlurb: >-\n  Tamara Santibañez of Discipline Press shares three of her favorite local\n  businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: >-\n  Tamara Santibañez shares three of her favorite local businesses in NYC with\n  @onbondstreet\n---\n![Leather Man](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/ATamara%20Santibanez%20Leather%20Man.jpg)\n## Leather Man\n\nTo out myself a little bit right off the bat, I’m a leather fetishist.

Flower Power came up during my research, so I started going there and it’s been this invaluable resource to me for over a decade now. At first, it was really intimidating as an experience, but it really starts feeling like an extension of your home the more you visit. I have a bunch of friends who’ve worked at Flower Power, and I’ve also met a great group of people through the store as well.

Through that, I made a bunch of friends because they were running book tables before “graduating” and opening up their own bookstores - seeing people take that path has been a constant thread of my New York experience. Molasses is no exception - it’s really cool when your friends have been around for a while, get the opportunity to step up, and end up owning their own shops.

It used to be the donut shoppe but they redid the interior and branding to be more inviting which upset me greatly. It's not, like, soignée but that's precisely why I love it. All the decisions make sense. I love the way they use a little hot water to heat up the cups before they fill it with decent-but-not-great coffee. I love the tiny, pill-bottle sized freshly squeezed orange juice they bring you gratis. I love that they sometimes don't bring it to you and don't tell you why. I love that people have to wait outside even if you have kids and put up a big stink about it. I love knowing who cuts the grapefruit segments really well and who doesn't. I love that they have three types of hot sauces ranging from Tabasco to Red Devil and that Tapatio is also an option. I love that they DON'T have Sriracha because the white dad demanding Sriracha at a diner can go straight to hell because overhearing him on any topic will make me want to die. I love that sometimes when I'm sitting at the bar I have to move if I'm in Carlito's favorite seat because having a fruit salad in that seat is a big part of his day.

It's taken a long time but I've gotten my Sahadi's haul strategy down to a level that I'm ridiculously proud of. There are two sections that are total gems, the pickles and “other sundries” section and the prepared food section. You have to take a number. I love places that have orderly processes. It's what I love about New York, that Soup Nazi M.O. shit that is necessitated by just how many fucking people you have to contend with for your resources. I'm full-time freelance and I think being able to go to Sahadi's in the dead-zone of 3PM to get my labne and in-house made za'atar pita chips provides a type of joy that reaffirms most of the decisions I've made about my career. Also, I don't know why but prosciutto here is a few bucks cheaper than anywhere else and sometimes they have pernil which is just some next-level decision making at a middle eastern spot that I respect and admire. Oh, also their bulk sesame seeds are cheap as hell and the cinnamon almonds and the wee pickles with garlic are life changing.\n\n![The Book Court](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Mary%20HK%20Choi%20Book%20Court.jpg)\n## Book Court\n\nThis place has a better comic book section than it needs to which I appreciate (even though the store totally has that personality where they'd parse the difference between comic books and 'graphic novels', which, LOL). And ever since they built in the back room with a skylight it's just a pleasure to stroll through. It's weird I had a kindle for a long time and loved it but I've gone back to pulp and it's been great. I also actually jibe with their Staff Picks.

The dirty water dog and the knish with smothered onions and spicy mustard are New York mainstays...to see vendors get taxed so heavily and exploited from so many angles is really frustrating to see. It’s tough to watch them disappear because a 7 Eleven needs to get put in. So many people take them for granted because there was a time where these stands really were pretty ubiquitous. Think about how many cats fed their families selling hot dogs and knishes. Whether it’s an old Polish cat, a Middle Eastern cat, or a Korean cat...I grew up seeing everyone who got off a boat or plane put their lives together selling hot dogs. It sucks to see them vanishing.\n\n## Junior’s Cheesecake\n\nI’m a nostalgia nerd. Junior’s has been around forever. When my mom and I moved to the city in ‘77, we could walk there from our old pad so it kind of holds a special place in my memories. Obviously, it’s still family owned. Whenever there was a reason for celebration, whether it was something at school or a birthday, the two of us - cuz it was only the two of us - we’d always go and share a slice of cheesecake.\n\n## Otto’s Shrunken Head\n\nI grew up in the hip hop scene, the punk scene, and the New York hardcore scene. I had a friend named Dan who moved here from San Diego via the Midwest - he was in a really good band called Thin Man. He was like, “man I’m moving to New York in two weeks” and I told him I’d take him up and down Avenue A and go to all the punk bars that I grew up with - ones with really good jukeboxes and all that. Turns out, they were all gone. All of them had flipped into real bridge and tunnel douchebag bars. We walked from Houston all the way up A and everything had closed. So we get to 14th and I’m like, “fuck,” so I wound up taking Dan to Otto’s. Otto’s isn’t that old but it’s kind of the last place where I can go hear garage rock or traditional skinhead reggae or go to a rockabilly night. Maybe even a crazy goth night. The cats that might have been in the St. Mark’s crowd in the ‘80s, they’re there. Otto’s is an important piece of New York that’s holding out; it’s the last bastion of something that’s truly New York to me.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nIndependent businesses have made the city what it is since forever - it’s why people came here to begin with; to start their own thing. “If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere,” you know? So why come to New York if the conditions are such that you can’t possibly start your own thing anymore? Why come to New York just to fall in line? Because it’s more ‘exciting’ here? Stay at home in fuckin’ Witchita or wherever - it’s easier to stay on the treadmill out there, I promise. Independent businesses are what make the city diverse, unique, and interesting...if we don’t protect them, we just become an unnecessarily difficult version of any other town.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"hot-dog-and-knish-stands\">Hot Dog and Knish Stands</h2>\n<p>I feel like those kinds of businesses are what the city was built on.

The trainers there (who are all family, literally) work with a really wide range of clientele - whether it’s Olympians like me and my boy Conor (Dwyer), actors, supermodels - who have very specific needs. So they’re extremely responsive and adaptive to all these different priorities. They know each body and what the focus needs to be. \n\nI think a big part of why all of these people come to Dogpound is because the atmosphere is great - no one wants your picture, no one cares who you are, you’re just here to work out really hard. It’s dark, it’s gritty, there aren’t too many lights - it’s not about caring what you look like. You’re here to work. There’s no excuses if you’re late, too - if you’re not on time you’re doing a hundred burpees and they’re already moving on without you. The team at Dogpound will have you do in 45 minutes what another spot would let you breeze through over the course of like, two hours. It’s a real gym.\n\n![Concepts](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Miles%20Chamley-Watson%20Concepts.jpg)\n## Concepts\nConcepts is a store that’s very close to me...literally, as they’re around the corner from The Dogpound. I’ve always appreciated how they blend high fashion with streetwear in their presentation at the shop. That keeps the whole experience accessible to everyone who stops in. That said, they’re obviously very selective with the designers who they bring on - whether it’s an established name or an up and coming brand, your line isn’t in Concepts unless you fit with their point of view....with what they’re trying to communicate. That feels different to me from how a lot of other shops, especially recently, will just buy anything and put it all out on the floor. Concepts does a great job of mixing high and low, which is exactly how I like to wear clothes. \n\nI also like that the people who work at Concepts are super knowledgeable and approachable. Concepts is originally a Boston thing, so obviously opening up a location in New York means you have to show and prove. This city will make or break you. So, it’s really all thanks to the team who works at the West Soho spot that Concepts is able to be so respected here. \n\n![Pier 59 Studios](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Miles%20Chamley-Watson%20Pier%20Studios.jpg)\n## Pier 59 Studios\nPier 59 is like a second home to me. I can’t tell you how many shoots I’ve done here - Nike, which was my first shoot here, to GQ to Self...the list goes on. Everything about Pier is perfect to me - the location, the aesthetic, the incredible people who work here, the food, the natural light, how enormous the studio spaces are. Oh, and the smoothies.\n\nThe most important thing is the familiarity, though. Every time I stop by, it’s “Hey Miles! How’ve you been?” I love the Pier team, man - they’re all so warm and happy. I’ve shot at almost every studio in the city and Pier is, by far, my favorite. Because it feels like home more than anything else. I’ve never had a bad experience here. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nThat’s just the way I was brought up. Whether it was when I was a kid in London or stopping by the bodega last night, supporting local businesses was just a value I was raised on.\n\nBut, I mean, aside from all the usual reasons, just think about starting something new for the first time. Like, you have no prior experience and are still going all in on something you’ve never done before. That’s what independent businesses are doing, right? They’re people, maybe your friends or family, even, who are starting fresh. And imagine if no one around them helped out at the beginning. Everyone needs a little help getting their foot in the door. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. I didn’t get to where I am by myself - you work hard and stay focused, but without good people pushing you it doesn’t happen. When I was competing in the Olympics, I had texts and emails coming in from the people at Dogpound, Pier, Concepts - that was so crucial to know people at home were watching me in that moment. So why wouldn’t I reciprocate, you know? Help people who help you. That’s how we all get ahead.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Miles%20Chamley-Watson%20Dogpound.jpg\" alt=\"The Dogpound\"><h2 id=\"the-dogpound\">The Dogpound</h2>\n<p>Dogpound is my gym; Nigel Barker introduced me to them.

I grew up in a very health-conscious household; it was always really important to my parents that they were feeding their children good food. As such, we’ve been coming to Angelica as a family since I was seven (I’m 33 now, for perspective). I think they’re one of the few businesses that are still around from that era because they’ve been able to adapt without losing the core of...well, the integrity that makes them wonderful. The food is absolutely wonderful and everyone who works there is unbelievably kind (but not in the hippy-dippy way LA is...which usually just makes me want to punch people in the face).

Trash and Vaudeville has always been a punk rock, counterculture clothing beacon. They were on St. Mark’s for about 30 years when St. Mark’s was still St. Mark’s. I’ll always remember being sixteen years old, walking by Trash and seeing Joey Ramone outside. That’s what it was all about; that’s what it represented. Trash was awesome because it felt more like a place for punks to hang out together as opposed to a business, really. Everyone would post up and you’d be able to find out about upcoming shows, new bands, and all of that. Today, St. Mark’s feels more like a food court in a mall than the epicenter of punk that it used to be. Due to the corresponding rent hikes that come with a transformation like that, Trash is now over on 7th between 1st and A.

An independent business will hire someone who a big company might unfairly pass on. Independent businesses build community and culture. We set trends that large corporations ultimately end up vulturing; you can observe that dynamic in everything from food to fashion to finance.

They continue to introduce interesting wines from small producers around the world, so, by supporting Ten Bells I know i&#39;m also giving a high five to some other independent businesses out there who are making some tasty wine.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Tomoko%20Ogura%20Burrow.jpg\" alt=\"Burrow\"><h2 id=\"burrow\">Burrow</h2>\n<p>For my birthday one year I received a butter cookie that was a depiction of my face.

My fave is their fried chicken. \n\n![Williamsburg Garment Company](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jacky%20Tang%20WIlliamsburg%20Garment%20Company.jpg)\n## Williamsburg Garment Company \nIt's been very interesting to watch and learn from my friend, Maurice Malone, the one man operation behind this 4-year-old brand. He recently opened a small brick-and-mortar shop in a space that he originally intended to use as an office. The simple storefront now supports his brand’s online and wholesale success. As one of the few key designers who defined hip hop fashion in the 90s, Maurice has experienced everything the industry can throw at someone - from being a CFDA nominee to dressing the likes of Aaliyah and Eminem. I appreciate that, in his second act, he's taken it back to basics and started a homegrown business all over again. His will and passion are very inspiring. \n\n![Studio 189](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jacky%20Tang%20Studio.jpg)\n## Studio 189 \nIn this time of fast fashion and mass trends, it's refreshing (and important, for that matter) to see some designers consider the ethics, message, and sustainability in both their practices and brand development. When I first met Abrima Erwiah and Rosario Dawson (the duo behind Studio 189), I was immediately drawn to their project as I am also involved in an organization called 14+ Foundation, which builds schools and promotes education in Africa. Since that first meeting, we've all been able to work with and support each other. In a way, we're building a community across different groups and industries but have a shared vision of ethical betterment for the world. The ladies recently designed the uniforms for the foundation’s schools, bringing everything full circle in a nice way. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nTo me, \"independent\" is the key and operative word here. When you're an independent business, that generally means you have more freedom and creativity at your disposal. These are two very important qualities for brand building: along with the freedom and creativity to generate products and services that push the envelope, you’re also afforded the freedom to mess up and creatively problem solve. You get to take chances that boards or investors or shareholders wouldn’t allow you to take. So, by virtue of this, independent businesses tend to be more interesting. \n\nAlso, as an independent business owner, you’re usually in direct contact with your customer and end user all the time. During the early stages of your business’ development, that communication really plays a key role in shaping the culture of your brand. Conversely, as a supporter of independent businesses, you are actually contributing and helping that company better serve your needs and give you more of what you want.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jacky%20Tang%20Kichin.jpg\" alt=\"Kichin\"><h2 id=\"kichin\">Kichin</h2>\n<p>Having grown up in Hawaii, I always think about the huge variety of multicultural quick bite options that is so readily accessible there (aside from the usual fare like burgers and pizza).

The people behind this place are incredibly supportive of local makers and I'm sure that's largely due to their own history in the neighborhood.

I live in South Brooklyn so I don't get to come here as often as I would like, but I am always impressed when I do. As a close friend of Bethany's for almost 15 years, I've had the opportunity to see some  of the process of opening and running your own store. This talented couple makes running two stores (and raising a kid, working on other projects, etc) look much easier than it is and the elegance with which they do it leaves a lasting impression on me. They also support local artists with regular art openings / shows, so check them out when your in the area!\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nAs a small business owner myself, I can't help but think of the excitement, stress, jubilation, love, sleeplessness, etc. that must happen on a daily basis for the people behind these operations. The idea that they are taking the time and risk to pursue a living by offering services and goods to the community every day is very admirable to me.

I have had my hot sauce in there for over 2 years now and I&#39;m extremely grateful for and proud of that.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Queen%20Majesty%20Home%20of%20the%20Brave.jpg\" alt=\"Home Of The Brave\"><h2 id=\"home-of-the-brave\">Home Of The Brave</h2>\n<p>This expertly curated shop belongs to Bethany &amp; Max Vogel, the same owners of the sister store a block away, Wolves Within. I live in South Brooklyn so I don&#39;t get to come here as often as I would like, but I am always impressed when I do. As a close friend of Bethany&#39;s for almost 15 years, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to see some  of the process of opening and running your own store. This talented couple makes running two stores (and raising a kid, working on other projects, etc) look much easier than it is and the elegance with which they do it leaves a lasting impression on me. They also support local artists with regular art openings / shows, so check them out when your in the area!</p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>As a small business owner myself, I can&#39;t help but think of the excitement, stress, jubilation, love, sleeplessness, etc. that must happen on a daily basis for the people behind these operations. The idea that they are taking the time and risk to pursue a living by offering services and goods to the community every day is very admirable to me.

I always try to convince him to buy certain things, but he’s got his own ideas so we find ourselves in heated debates quite often! I love the fact that he’s persevered and is still doing well despite how corporate players are completely overwhelming the food retail space. I suppose I’d call Gourmet Garage the biggest of the little guys - it’s really admirable to me that Andy can occupy this niche...his brand is so distinct, which is what will ultimately allow him to persist and survive. Whether you’re conscious of it or not, at Gourmet Garage you’ll always be exposed to a selection of produce and food that is diverse, fairly priced, and curated with a distinct point of view. That’s what I attribute their longevity to.\n\n![Ladurée](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ariane%20Daguin%20Laduree.jpg)\n## Ladurée\nLadurée arrived in New York a few years ago, but in France it is obviously a big, family-run operation that has an extremely strong legacy around it. Normally, heritage businesses like Ladurée are run very conservatively in France. Conversely, these guys are extremely dynamic in their decision-making and international expansion. That isn’t to say that they aren’t extremely pragmatic as well; they did significant market research and figured out exactly where and how they needed to make an impact here. Their attention to detail is second to none - you can clearly see that when you walk through their incredible West Broadway space. My family and friends will have very lively brunches in the garden quite often. \n\n![Felix](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ariane%20Daguin%20Felix.jpg)\n## Felix\nAha, Felix. What can I say about Felix? The chef, Pierre, makes these really mean buffalo wings. We’ll try some shortly. Pierre is one of my oldest customers in the city and is from the same region, the southwest of France, as I am. Because we share these roots, there’s a shorthand between us - we’ve never had to explain things to each other. He knows exactly what I mean and vice versa. I’ve always admired how hard Pierre works while still being passionate about his craft and having fun with it. I want to make it very clear that Pierre is a true bistro chef - he brings very traditional dishes made perfectly. To the T. That isn’t actually as common a thing in New York or the States as people might think. Pierre will sometimes call us up and say, “hey I have sweetbreads tonight” or something like that, and we’ll all rush over to see what he’s come up with. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nLet me put it this way - in my business, it is essential for me to promote sustainable practices and biodiversity. If you neglect certain species or breeds of animals, the entire ecosystem collapses. American bison, for instance, were on the verge of extinction until it was decided that they could be raised for meat. Suddenly, you see the population bounce back into healthy numbers and the environment becomes more balanced for it. Look at what’s happening to bees, now. Individually, bees are tiny! What impact could they make on anything bigger than themselves? And yet, if bees die out, what pollinates plants? \n\nI’m sorry to make comparisons between animals and independent business owners, but I feel that the metaphor works! If you don’t support independent businesses, things become imbalanced. We invariably end up with towns that look like homogenous malls full of the same boring stuff. Without diversity, there’s no reason to leave your home. There’s nothing new or interesting to experience. To keep the interaction between economy, communities, and culture healthy, you must support the little guys.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Ariane%20Daguin%20Gourmet%20Garage.jpg\" alt=\"Gourmet Garage\"><h2 id=\"gourmet-garage\">Gourmet Garage</h2>\n<p>I’ve known Andy, the owner of Gourmet Garage, for years because he’s a D’artagnan client.

Working for companies whose product, services, and ethos I fully believe in is crucial for me, so I’ve also been a regular customer here since day one.

Looking to recreate the chirashi-dons we ate there almost daily, we started getting our groceries from here. Coming from Finland, I’m pretty picky when it comes to fish, and theirs is always fresh and reasonably priced - not a given in New York! They also seem to have some kind of magic avocado stash, as I’ve never not gotten a perfectly ripe one.

It has this fantastic build-out that highlights young, contemporary designers through a tightly curated selection of pieces. They also sell home goods and special items on occasion. While there’s decidedly a minimalist lens across the whole experience, it never comes off as try-hard or superficial, which I appreciate. While spare, there’s a lot of personality in every decision they’ve made - that keeps the shop fun and, most importantly, memorable. Next time you’re in Bed Stuy you should definitely make a point of checking Sincerely, Tommy out.\n\n## Fig Collective\nJ: So Fig Collective is out in Bushwick. It’s a super quirky, young boutique that’s by appointment only. You have to walk up to the fourth floor of this industrial building way out to find it. Fig Collective is special because they’re one of the few spaces that carries (almost exclusively) young, upstart, and non-American designers. One of my favorite brands that they stock is called Ader Error, which you can only really order from Korea right now. It’s really cool to visit and see how guys like these are figuring out how to push things forward.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nJ: This is something we think about a lot as we build our own business. New York is by no means the cheapest or easiest city to start a company in. In fact, it might be one of the toughest places to make that commitment. The amount of creativity needed to navigate every hurdle this city throws at you speaks to how worthy of your respect businesses that make it here actually are. They’ve succeeded despite nearly insurmountable odds and kept their integrity intact - that definitely stands for something.\n\nK: I would say that every amazing big business was once a small business. Without small businesses you end up missing what makes America so great. I think - well, no, I know - that small businesses are the most important part of the American economy. To Jeff’s point, beyond the economics and the fundamental premise of our employment, I’d reiterate that independent businesses are really driven by passion and creativity. So supporting them is understanding how significant a role they play in pushing culture and the economy forward.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"cafe-integral\">Cafe Integral</h2>\n<p>K: Founded by the amazing Cesar Vega, Cafe Integral brings legit Nicaraguan coffee to Soho through their shop, which shares a space with American Two Shot on Grand Street.

The amount of creativity needed to navigate every hurdle this city throws at you speaks to how worthy of your respect businesses that make it here actually are. They’ve succeeded despite nearly insurmountable odds and kept their integrity intact - that definitely stands for something.</p><p>K: I would say that every amazing big business was once a small business. Without small businesses you end up missing what makes America so great. I think - well, no, I know - that small businesses are the most important part of the American economy. To Jeff’s point, beyond the economics and the fundamental premise of our employment, I’d reiterate that independent businesses are really driven by passion and creativity. So supporting them is understanding how significant a role they play in pushing culture and the economy forward.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-07-09 11:26 -0400","published":true,"title":"Kal Vepuri and Jeff Johnson","description":"co-founders - <a href=\"http://thearrivals.com/\">The Arrivals</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/img_1202_1024.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Kal Vepuri and Jeff Johnson (The Arrivals)","socialBlurb":"The Arrivals co-founders share their three favorite local businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@kalvepuri & Jeff Johnson of @TheArrivalsNYC share their 3 favorite local businesses in NYC with @onbondstreet"},{"name":"sara-elise-and-ora-wise","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-07-19 17:53 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Sara Elise and Ora Wise\npartnerLogo: /images/logos/thumbtack.png\ndescription: >-\n  founder and chef partner - <a href=\"http://harvestandrevel.com/\">Harvest &\n  Revel</a>\nimage: >-\n  https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sara%20Elise%20and%20Ora%20Wise%20Main%20Portrait.jpg\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Harvest & Revel '\nsocialBlurb: >-\n  Harvest & Revel founder and chef partner share 3 of their favorite businesses\n  in NYC.\ntweetText: >-\n  .@HarvestandRevel founder and chef partner share 3 of their favorite\n  businesses in NYC with @onbondstreet\n---\n![Veggies](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sara%20Elise%20and%20Ora%20Wise%20Veggies.jpg)\n## Veggies\nVeggies (on Nostrand) is the place we go to have a green juice or small snack - knowing that we're supporting black-owned, community-based businesses is important to us.

They have hundreds of colorful fish in tanks stacked up to the ceiling and a few very impressive show tanks scattered around the store.

These days, however, with ticket prices hanging around $20 a screening, going to the theater isn’t as accessible as it should be. Syndicated offers movies both old and new, (from Romero’s original The Living Dead series to this year’s White Girl) for 3 bucks - and you can order a beer and dinner from your seat. The massive bar and restaurant outside of the theater really establishes the sense that you’re in this vintage, art deco space complete with tall ceilings, art-nouveau ornamental lighting, and a full island bar. The details place you in this romanticized experience of feeling like you're at a movie theater in the 70s.

For the most part, everybody who comes to Brooklyn Boulders is respectful, helpful, and friendly.

While BK Boulders obviously has various walls that allow you to explore everything from bouldering to top-roping, it also offers spaces for you to get some work done, a small gym, classes, and a small sauna as well. These features make it really easy to spend at least few hours whenever you walk through their doors. I also appreciate that BK Boulders has a culture that eliminates any sort of unnecessary alpha-bro competitiveness, allowing you to really focus on yourself, both physically and mentally. Name one person who never - even as a kid - wanted to climb up a bunch of rocks. That's who this place is for, in the most open-minded and judgement-free setting. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nThere is something so special about going to a restaurant, cafe, or shop and interacting directly with the owner (or people not so far removed from the owner). Meeting people who are equally passionate about their product and customers make independent businesses vastly more appealing than massive, corporate-owned enterprises where you’re always forced to wonder if the people working there actually even give a shit. In an age when you can purchase services or products without any physical interaction whatsoever, the ability to humanize - to engage beyond the facade of a website or social media is so vital to me...and that’s why indie businesses are so important to every single community.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Shawna%20X%20Brooklyn%20Ball%20Factory.jpg\" alt=\"Brooklyn Ball Factory\"><h2 id=\"brooklyn-ball-factory\">Brooklyn Ball Factory</h2>\n<p>I always come here to get good coffee - the kind that someone who really knows and loves coffee makes...ok, that&#39;s not all - I come here to get coffee AND onigiri, or whatever other assortment of various japanese dishes I might be feeling that day.

We don’t have to go through layers and layers of hierarchy before putting something out in front of our customers. People get excited when they can experience a brand that hasn’t been filtered a billion times. They know they’re getting us.\n\n_Olivia_: You can’t replicate that - people see right through big company initiatives that are designed to mimic what independent businesses do. If you want the benefits of being a local, independent business, you have to be a local, independent business.\n\n_Steph_: While we’re talking about us here, this is completely applicable to any other independent businesses out there.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"/fornewyork/images/OliviaWolfeandStephKrasnoffGrassRootsJuiceryMain.jpg\" alt=\"Grass Roots Juicery\"><h2 id=\"grass-roots-juicery\">Grass Roots Juicery</h2>\n<p><em>Olivia</em>: Grass Roots is owned by one of our closest friends, Sabrina Diaz.

There’s something at the store for anyone who likes surfing, fishing, hiking - really any New Yorker who kind of has one foot in that outdoor lifestyle. Pilgrim took off because they were able to curate an amazing selection of brands and items that you can’t find anywhere else within this very considered, thoughtfully designed space. They hit the mark so hard, actually, that everyone else just ended up boosting their style. You had minivans from every corporation out front for a while, you know, sending their people inside to figure out what they could boost and apply to their own retail. \n\nSo, instead of being too pissy about it, the Pilgrim guys just pushed themselves to take the next step, which was to design their own clothing line. They don’t go about doing that half-assed, either. The line is very focused on using sustainable or recyclable materials, it’s made in Japan (where they also opened up a store), and...you know, right now, it’s expensive to manufacture that way, but these are quality pieces that are extremely durable and will last for a long time. It’s the opposite of the waste you see going on in fast fashion. There are definitely similarities to what Patagonia was doing early on. \n\nI won’t go to a brick and mortar anymore unless I really feel like I’m getting an actual experience out of it. Pilgrim always delivers on that.\n\n![Spoonbill & Sugartown](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Kimou%20Meyer%20Spoonbill.jpg)\n## Spoonbill & Sugartown\nI’m a book hoarder. I own way too many books. So it goes without saying that I love Spoonbill, which has been in the neighborhood for almost two decades now. They’re about to get priced out of Bedford thanks to the crazy rent hikes going on in Williamsburg, which is really tragic because it’s become such a staple in the community. The good news is, Spoonbill was smart enough to see the writing on the wall - they opened a warehouse in Bushwick a few years ago, so they’ll be moving the retail operation to that location, as well. \n\nThere’s a smell that’s unique to small bookstores - coming from Europe, that smell always reminds me of the architectural book store my dad would take me to when I was a kid. You know, you’d have the owner smoking cigarettes inside with two cats sitting on top of everything. It’s ridiculous, but there’s a vibe and energy that you get in spaces like these that you simply cannot replicate in big chains. A bookstore should feel alive. Spoonbill feels that way for me. \n\nWilliamsburg has obviously changed a lot, but it’s still a very artist-driven neighborhood. So whenever you have someone who’s moving out of town and can’t be bothered to take his books with him, or someone who’s cleaning her studio out, these people will all bring their collections to Spoonbill. Whenever that happens, I’m down there doing what’s basically the bookstore equivalent of digging for records. The guys know me well enough now that they’ll let me go through stuff that hasn’t been marked for sale yet. It speaks to how essential Spoonbill is to the community that Kim Gordon will just bring over 20 copies of her autobiography, signed, or that KAWS will come in and sign his book for them because he knows it’ll up the sale value. When we do a new issue of VICTORY, we’ll just drop a box off at the store off the strength. These guys are super important to all of us. \n\n![Samurai Mama](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Kimou%20Meyer%20Samurai%20Mama.jpg)\n## Samurai Mama\nI love what the owners of this place are doing, both here and at their other restaurants, Bozu and Papa Samurai. I like the fact that it’s not just cliche, American adaptations of sushi and bento boxes. They’ve really keyed into authentic Japanese comfort food, whether it’s sushi, udon, ramen, or other dishes like their homemade ravioli. It feels like a real izakaya that you might find yourself at in Tokyo. Or someone’s kitchen at home. A lot of people pass by on their way to other spots, and it’s like, man...you have no idea what you’re missing! \n\nI have kids so I don’t really go out too much anymore, but this is a great place to take the family for dinner or just for me to stop by alone during lunch. My kids are always asking to come here. If you come by during off hours, it’s really mellow, but after 8 it’s absolutely crazy packed. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses\nWell, first and foremost, I grew up with parents who were small business owners. They made scale models for architects and worked together for 46 years. My mom had an internship with Le Corbusier, met my dad while they were both getting their master’s, fell in love, and decided to start this business (which didn’t really exist at the time) up. 46 years! I learned from them what it means to be independent...what self-determination means. My dad would always tell me to go buy groceries or whatever at the local shop, not the big chain, because the former was run by a guy like him who had kids like me. So I really associated independence with family from an early age, as well.\n\nNow, because so much of our lives are online, the physical experience of interacting with a business feels a lot more emotional to me. You can feel things, you can smell them - the immediacy of that tactile experience is really valuable. So that plays into how we operate Doubleday, too, you know? We’ll work with big corporate accounts that can singlehandedly keep the lights on in our office, but we’ll also make sure to turn around and do pro bono work for small businesses that we believe in. It’s really essential that we contribute to maintaining that balance.\n\n_Photographs by David Brandon Geeting_\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Kimou%20Meyer%20Pilgrim.jpg\" alt=\"Pilgrim Surf + Supply\"><h2 id=\"pilgrim-surf-supply\">Pilgrim Surf + Supply</h2>\n<p>Pilgrim is owned by two friends of mine; they’ve become a real community hub for the neighborhood.

Mike put together the shop as a pretty modest venture early on; since then, he’s brought on some new partners and now they’re this real powerhouse. They get amazing collections; recently, they came up on a huge collection of early 80s, UK indie, Factory Records, and early dance stuff. I find their whole perspective really cool because it’s such an agnostic outlook on music - you’ll find everything there. I never know what I’ll find there so I associate Captured with a real sense of discovery. It’s also great that it’s literally underground.\n\n![Co-Op 87](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/SamValentiCoOp87.jpg)\n\n## Co-Op 87\n\nCo-Op 87, I think, came out of the Mexican Summer family. I don’t know what the space used to be before they took over, but it’s cool how it looks like it was carved out of the existing architecture around it. To me, it feels like record stores I used to go to when I was a kid. Ben’s a real maven; his perspectives and selection are really peerless - he’ll hold a  lot of stuff like boogie, drum-n-bass, reggae, hip hop records that are all rooted in dance DNA. He helped me out bigtime when I was going through this original 90s R&B records kick; a lot of them weren’t available on vinyl for a while, so he found me a bunch of Jamaican bootlegs of Boyz II Men and Toni Braxton stuff with like scans of the CDs blown up on the covers. Co-Op is cool because it goes super accessible and esoteric at once.\n\n![Academy Records](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/AcademyRecords.jpg)\n\n## Academy Records\n\nAcademy is like the Chez Panisse of record stores - everyone who works there goes on to start their own record stores. There’s almost a mini-Amoeba vibe to it; you really feel like you could spend hours there. Some big, big records will always hit those walls - I got the first two Kraftwerk records there. Whenever DJs or artists come in from out of town, I always take them to Academy. You’ll always find some joints you never knew you wanted, but played in that context it makes total sense. That’s exactly what a good store should do - make you see things differently than you would have before. I take bigger risks with purchases in there because I feel like they’ve already combed the sand a bit.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nI don’t think bigger companies are bad, per se, but it’s about having options. A healthy neighborhood will have a constellation of smaller businesses balancing the big boxes out, and the community usually ends up better for it. Also, you really learn how to run a company when you work at a small business. All of the guys and girls who work at Ghostly have their own side labels and projects - hopefully what we’ve done is shown them that running their own thing is a viable pursuit. If you don’t have a functional independent business to refer to, how would you know that that’s something you can do on your own?\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/SamValentiCapturedTracks.jpg\" alt=\"Captured Tracks\"><h2 id=\"captured-tracks\">Captured Tracks</h2>\n<p>Captured Tracks is one of my favorite labels.

It is a cheap fruit and veggies mecca-- every day they have some kind of berry for a dollar, they always have cut watermelon and pineapple and most days they have ripe avocados for a buck. I usually decide what I am going to have for dinner based on what they have in stock. I asked that they start carrying a certain kind of pickle and the next week they had it.

I was new to coffee when I started going there, but now I'm a full fledged caffeine addict and pop by every day.

It is a cheap fruit and veggies mecca-- every day they have some kind of berry for a dollar, they always have cut watermelon and pineapple and most days they have ripe avocados for a buck.

This place is a true, old school mom and pop operation - they sell all kinds of shoulder pads, linings, and other pieces or components that you need for tailored construction. It’s hard to find that kind of - and, honestly, that level of - specialization in the city anymore. There’s also this lovely woman named Nancy who works there... \n\nM: She does everything for us. Full garments, really anything. Since day one.\n\nD: From punched rivets to covered buttons. You name it. Speaking of which, she knows everyone by name except for mine because she can’t pronounce it. But yeah, Steinlauf is cool - it’s an OG garment district hideout. We found out about it years ago just because we were running around trying to figure production out here in the neighborhood.\n\nM: We still see her to this day whenever we walk by. She’s the sweetest lady ever.\n\n## Los Tacos\nM: Spot two is definitely Los Tacos. That’s pretty much our hands-down favorite place to get tacos here in the city. Anytime we have meetings at Milk or in the area around Chelsea Market, we always make sure to squeeze in 15 minutes to get a Los Tacos taco. The trick is to ask them for the special menu - not too many people know about it, but go to that special menu. \n\nWe met one of the owners because we’ve been such frequent customers there from the beginning. Back then, the guys who own the spot used to be behind the counter more often. One of them had read about what we were doing online or something and said what’s up when he saw us stop by. The last time we spoke he asked us to design a wedding suit for him but the timing didn’t work out. We have to do something together soon. Los Tacos is our spot.\n\n## Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli\nD: Saigon Vietnamese is spot three. You can’t go wrong here. It’s a family-owned joint with the simplest menu of all time. Banh Mi. Pork or chicken, spicy or regular. That’s it. I take chicken, spicy, no cilantro. \n\nM: I do pork, spicy, no cilantro. \n\nD: We’ve been going there since 2008 when we first launched Public School. Our office at the time was down on Grand and Crosby, so when we saw that long-ass line coming out of Saigon, we just stopped there and ended up becoming regulars for the whole time we were based in the neighborhood. The bread is perfectly crunchy - maybe too perfectly crunchy - if you eat a lot of it there’s a high probability that you’re going to cut the roof of your mouth. It’s still the perfect meal in a sandwich, though.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nD: Because that’s where the flavor’s at. Independent businesses are started by the kind of people who want to do things differently from the norm. They bring a unique point of view that’s a little sharper because it doesn’t have to be mass or commercial. In other words, independent business owners are the ones who really set trends, regardless of the industry they’re in. As independent owners ourselves, we identify with those values - they’re standards that we try to hold Public School to. It’s admirable when you’re willing to struggle for the love of what you’re doing...when your professional pursuit isn’t driven by the need to generate more and more money, but to provide a service, craft, or product that has a character all of its own. \n\nM: Perfect.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"steinlauf-and-stoller\">Steinlauf and Stoller</h2>\n<p>D: Spot one is definitely Steinlauf and Stoller, right here by Public School HQ in the heart of the Garment District. 39th between 7th and 8th.

They’ve lived in New York for a while - I believe the Soho location opened sometime in the late 80s. To their credit, the team behind IF was looking into buying brands like Comme des Garcons and Yohji [Yamamoto] before anyone really understood or knew too much about them. As someone who appreciates those brands and also as someone who worked at Comme des Garcons in Japan during the early days, I got to meet many of the groundbreaking store owners who were willing to take risks - I really respect the IF sisters because of that. Who, at that time, really knew what to do with those clothes? Sometimes it was even a little over the top for me! Similarly, when the Belgian designers first emerged - like Martin [Margiela] and Ann [Demeulemeester] - IF was the first to take them on. They’d always have the best, strongest pieces that big department stores would stay away from. That tradition continues to this day at IF, which is why I love going there as much as I did when they first opened. \n\n![G&G Cleaners and Alteration](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Stella%20Ishii%20G%20and%20G%20Cleaners.jpg)\n## G&G Cleaners and Alteration\nG&G has been a neighborhood mainstay since forever. As a fashion showroom, one of our constant needs is fast cleaning and alterations. As representatives of other people’s brands, we’re entrusted with holding many of their samples.

I tried pilates and yoga, but those didn’t really do much for me, so I was very intrigued to learn more when I first heard about gyrotonics. Movement is run by women who are dancers, which is something I appreciated tremendously. I like how simple the studio is and how reasonably priced classes are, especially compared to fancier gyrotonic studios. They only take about five people per class, so although it’s technically in a group setting, you get a lot of individualized attention. Health-wise, it’s certainly helped me a lot - I think my posture and stance is straighter than it’s ever been - and mentally I feel more focused.

Maintaining that spirit is what allows you to explore and try new things without feeling constrained. At its core, running your own company is all about trusting yourself - that autonomy is what ultimately allows you to take great risks. Of course, you have to look at what’s happening around you and refer to the numbers as well, but a lot of decision-making comes down to following your instincts. So when you support an independent business, you’re supporting a true reflection of the person or people behind it. \n\nCultivating a human connection between everyone who plays a role in a business is such a magical thing. For us, that begins with the team and extends outward to our designers and customers. Those relationships, no matter how humble, are what make this journey more important than just a series of transactions - it gets very hard to replicate that in a regimented, corporate environment.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Stella%20Ishii%20IF.jpg\" alt=\"IF Boutique\"><h2 id=\"if-boutique\">IF Boutique</h2>\n<p>IF is owned by two sisters from Beirut, where they actually have another location of IF. They’ve lived in New York for a while - I believe the Soho location opened sometime in the late 80s. To their credit, the team behind IF was looking into buying brands like Comme des Garcons and Yohji [Yamamoto] before anyone really understood or knew too much about them. As someone who appreciates those brands and also as someone who worked at Comme des Garcons in Japan during the early days, I got to meet many of the groundbreaking store owners who were willing to take risks - I really respect the IF sisters because of that. Who, at that time, really knew what to do with those clothes? Sometimes it was even a little over the top for me! Similarly, when the Belgian designers first emerged - like Martin [Margiela] and Ann [Demeulemeester] - IF was the first to take them on. They’d always have the best, strongest pieces that big department stores would stay away from. That tradition continues to this day at IF, which is why I love going there as much as I did when they first opened. </p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Stella%20Ishii%20G%20and%20G%20Cleaners.jpg\" alt=\"G&amp;G Cleaners and Alteration\"><h2 id=\"g-g-cleaners-and-alteration\">G&amp;G Cleaners and Alteration</h2>\n<p>G&amp;G has been a neighborhood mainstay since forever. As a fashion showroom, one of our constant needs is fast cleaning and alterations. As representatives of other people’s brands, we’re entrusted with holding many of their samples.

So, when I first got here, I did exactly what I do whenever I land in any city: I asked people (in this case, my friend Josh Luber, who started StockX) where the best sneaker spot is. To me, a good sneaker shop is a central, cultural hub for a very specific type of person. I’m talking about 80s, 90s babies who are into the cultural forces that shaped my childhood - hip hop, basketball, and sneakers. While something like Champs or Foot Locker is as bland as it is ubiquitous, finding a locally owned sneaker spot and talking to the people who hang out there will tell you a lot about what that city’s into. I’ll always try to stop by Stadium Goods for half an hour whenever I have some time on the weekends.\n\n![Frank’s Chop Shop](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Hasan%20Minhaj%20Frank's%20Chop%20Shop.jpg)\n## Frank’s Chop Shop\nJordan Klepper is like my big brother at The Daily Show. When I first joined, Klepper was like, “hey, welcome to the city,” and I immediately noticed how similarly pompadour-ish and newscaster-y our hairstyles looked. It was like...damn, I’m you in brownface and you’re me in whiteface! So I asked him what’s good - where do you get your hair cut? And he told me to go down to Frank’s Chop Shop - that’s the spot. Klepper lives in Brooklyn now, so he has a place he goes to out there, but at the time, he was always hitting up Chop Shop. A few other dudes cosigned it, as well. \n\nYou gotta realize, I grew up in Davis, California - which is basically strip malls, sadness, and fields. So, during those years, you’d just go to the nearest Supercuts and pray. You’d pray that they wouldn’t fuck it up too badly. It wasn’t until I got my grown man on that I realized there were specific barber shops you could go to and walk out without regret. Prior to that, I’d always graded my haircuts on a bell curve, like, if this manages to look OK in four or five days, that was acceptable. So once I got that TV money I started coming to Frank’s Chop Shop and since then, two guys - Yuk and Danny - have taken care of me. Those guys...any good barber, really...are like therapists - they know what’s going on in your head, what’s on your head, the shape of your head...they really know a lot about what’s happening in and on your dome. The point of this story is, don’t put yourself in the wrong hands when it comes to barber shops - that could fuck your whole life up. It’s very much a Professor X or Magneto situation, you know what I mean?\n\n![Burgers by Honest Chops](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Hasan%20Minhaj%20Burgers%20by%20Honest%20Chops.jpg)\n## Burgers by Honest Chops\nMy wife is a phenomenal cook. I’m not overhyping her - she’s incredible. Just yesterday, we’re sitting on the couch and she’s like, “hm. I’m kinda hungry. You want some seared salmon and risotto?” That’s the way her mind works, whereas I’m like, Top Ramen or Honey Bunches of Oats with almond milk...and maybe I’ll chop some bananas up into the Honey Bunches of Oats if I’m really trying to treat myself. Meanwhile, she’s already at pan-seared fish. So the relationship she has with people she buys ingredients from is very important to her. The opinion of a great, local butcher is crucial because they really know what’s good. It’s about being close to the source, right? Like, before anything hits the market floor, if you can go directly to the butcher, he or she is hooking you up with the best chops of meat.\n\nSo my wife has been going to the Honest Chops guys for a long time, and they opened up a halal butchery. Despite the specificity of that endeavor, their clientele really is everybody - the quality of the meat is so on point that you can’t help but to mess with them. It was really gratifying for me to see these guys open something up for a particular community but be embraced by everybody in the neighborhood. In fact, their ground meat was so good, people would always tell my boy Khalid (who owns Honest Chops) that he should open a burger shop. So that’s what he did. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom would make like, Desi versions of burgers. And don’t get me wrong, I love McDonald’s burgers, so at the time, I wasn’t trying to have a Desi-fied version of burgers. But now that I’m older, I’ll always catch myself being like, “yo...I miss that!” I didn’t even know what I had! The Honest Chops turkey burger has a spicy, masala-like vibe to it, which reminds me of how my mom used to make her burgers, so I love it. It’s one of my favorite burgers in the city.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nI think your decision to support independent businesses ties directly into the level of civic pride you have in your city. It’s about how much you care about maintaining the vibrancy of your city’s cultural tapestry. Independent businesses give cities their shape, texture, color, and taste...often literally. Communities are built around them. I appreciate local businesses because I grew up in a town that was very Anytown, USA. That landscape was completely saturated with Targets, Whole Foods, Starbucks...any big box business you could name. The argument for these massive, corporate enterprises, of course, is “well, we provide a much more scalable solution at a better price.” Ironically, that’s just made it so that I want so support independent businesses more; if I see a local barbershop or market competing with these guys, I’m willing to pay the same amount or even more of a premium to get the feeling and experience you can only find through small businesses.\n\nI’m saying all of this as a touring comedian, so the proof is in the pudding. Some of the most horrific experiences I’ve had on the road are like...I’ll go to certain cities, wake up in my hotel room, go to the local shopping area, and it feels like Groundhog Day. Because it’s the same Chipotle, Borders, Wal-Mart - one after the other. Rinse and repeat. Look, I get that a lot of people feel like, “oh, I like being able to get the same thing everywhere I am. That’s really convenient.” But to me, that feels like the worst kind of dystopian future. I don’t like that at all. So, yeah - it’s a texture, flavor, and shape thing with independent businesses. Whatever city I’m in, I’m looking for those places and, as someone who lives in New York, I hope this city never loses that.\n\n\n_Photographs by David Brandon Geeting_\n\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Hasan%20Minhaj%20Stadium%20Goods.jpg\" alt=\"Stadium Goods\"><h2 id=\"stadium-goods\">Stadium Goods</h2>\n<p>A running theme throughout all these stories is gonna be, “when I first moved to New York…”.

Whatever city I’m in, I’m looking for those places and, as someone who lives in New York, I hope this city never loses that.</p><p><em>Photographs by David Brandon Geeting</em></p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-08-17 13:40 -0400","published":true,"title":"Hasan Minhaj","description":"<a href=\"http://www.hasanminhaj.com/\">comedian</a>, correspondent - <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah\">The Daily Show</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Hasan%20Minhaj%20Main%20Portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Hasan Minhaj","socialBlurb":"Comedian and Daily Show Correspondent Hasan Minhaj shares his 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.","tweetText":"@hasanminhaj from the @TheDailyShow shares his 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC"},{"name":"lyndsey-butler","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-08-04 11:19 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: 'Lyndsey Butler '\ndescription: 'founder, creative director -<a href=\"http://www.thisisveda.com/\">VEDA</a>'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Lyndsey%20Butler%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Lyndsey Butler '\nsocialBlurb: >-\n  VEDA founder and creative director Lyndsey Butler shares her 3 favorite\n  independent businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: >-\n  .@thisisVEDA founder Lyndsey Butler shares her 3 favorite independent\n  businesses in NYC\n---\n![Karma](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Lyndsey%20Butler%20Karma.jpg)\n## Karma\nKarma is new to the Lower East Side, but it’s already proven to be the perfect addition to our neighborhood.

But these small businesses know they need to preserve something greater than just the bottom line, and they show that by running their companies with some soul and style.

More importantly, this space is my canvas. It’s the medium by which I’m able to continually tell my story...you can tell what I’m probably going through by the way everything changes and shifts in here. So, in a lot of ways, this is how I channel and articulate a lot of the mental or spiritual things I’ve been experiencing. \n\nI love finding new designers and seeing how pieces from them interact with each other on the racks. I love the people who I meet here - whether it’s my team (who always puts me onto stuff I’ve never heard about) or regular customers or complete strangers who just wander in. Sincerely, Tommy has provided me with this venue to learn more about people’s stories and what inspires them. So, as much as it is a business and a canvas, this place is also my number one hangout spot. It’s allowed me to spend my time doing something that’s way more than a job - none of this ever feels like work and I’m so fortunate to be able to chase what I’m passionate about every day. \n\n## Lovers Rock\nMy second spot would definitely have to be Lovers Rock. The owners, Alex and Shane, are really amazing people. It’s one of the few places in Bed Stuy that has a younger crowd but maintains this old school vibe. The soundtrack at Lovers Rock is a perpetual mix of reggae, 90s hip hop, r&b, and sometimes house - so, you know, that pretty much covers all the bases. There’s an awesome backyard you can smoke in, which is always a tremendous added bonus to any venue in New York. It’s just one of those places that can keep everyone drinking and dancing forever. Yeah - the vibe is perfect whether you’re trying to chill or have a completely wild night. Oh, and it’s also a block away from my house, so no complaints about that! \n\n## Calaca\nMy third spot is Calaca. I love this place. Like Lovers Rock, it’s really close to Sincerely, Tommy and my house. The owner is great; she’s my age and from Mexico. The really rad thing is that her mom does all the cooking and the kitchen is set up so they can maintain the original flavors she grew up with. So, what you ultimately get here is really traditional, excellent, what-you’d-eat-at-your-grandmother’s-house style Mexican food. She specializes in mezcal, too, so you can go there and try mezcal combinations that you definitely won’t find elsewhere in the city. The decor is great, the energy is awesome...Calaca is just another perfect example of an essential local spot. Simple as that.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nWe work our asses off, man! Support me working my ass off! No, but honestly, there’s a lot of heart and soul that goes into starting and maintaining an independent business. You’re looking at endeavors that people commit to while knowing that these probably won’t generate a ton of income or return for them straight off the bat. You have to be all in while facing the fact that there are no guarantees down this path. \n\nWhat I really love about strong independent businesses is how you can understand their owners’ stories by stepping into their spaces or experiencing what they make and do. And it’s not just about them as individuals, but you also get a sense for what the community around that business stands for. Each of the businesses I chose tells its own distinct story...they make it really easy for you to just submerge yourself and get lost in these spaces. They’re also very New Bed Stuy while respecting the heritage of the neighborhood...none of them just happen to be here - starting them in this community was a very intentional decision on all of our parts, and it’s important that new local businesses help push things forward while staying true to what came before us.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"sincerely-tommy\">Sincerely, Tommy</h2>\n<p>I guess the answer behind this one is a little obvious - Sincerely, Tommy is my business!

Jean Lin started Colony in 2014 and it’s just one block down from Uprise Art on Canal Street. We love being neighbors. During Design Week, Colony hosted movie nights, yoga classes, donut breaks and manicure parties.\n\nTheir open loft space is filled with light, plants, and typically great tunes. It’s like a little oasis of calm sitting above Canal. Jean curates furniture, lighting, wallpaper and textiles that all have a unifying aesthetic - clean lines, beautiful raw materials, and geometric shapes - and many of the pieces are made right here in New York.\n\n![Uprise Art](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Tze%20Chun%20Uprise%20Art.jpg)\n## Uprise Art\nI spend more time at Uprise Art than anywhere else, and I love coming to work every day.\n\nUprise Art is an online gallery for the next generation of art collectors. We represent contemporary emerging artists and help people find original one-of-a-kind artwork. Working surrounded by amazing pieces from our collection reminds me of why we do what we do.\n\nIt's great being downtown (Broadway and Canal) because collectors and interior designers stop in all the time to see new works, or to just say hi. More than half of our artists live and work in NYC, so I make studio visits or they’ll come by our office to catch up.\n\nNew York is the center of the art world, so in owning a gallery here, there’s the feeling that if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nPearl S. Buck said, “all things are possible until they are proven impossible.” I moved to NYC fourteen years ago because, like millions of other people, I knew it was a place where you could carve out your own little corner, and where the possibilities were endless.\n\nAyr, Colony, and Uprise Art all look at the creative landscape and consider how things can be done better.\n\nBy supporting independent businesses - where everything is on the line, teams are nimble, and resources are hard won rather than given - you’re making innovation possible.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Tze%20Chun%20AYR.jpg\" alt=\"AYR\"><h2 id=\"ayr\">AYR</h2>\n<p>My friends Jac Cameron and Maggie Winter launched AYR in 2014.

It’s a two-pronged business - the first is educating refugees, all women, on how to learn skillsets in the kitchen (especially making bread). It’s a really amazing program that empowers people to not only learn new skills but go out into the market and build viable careers off of them. The second part of her company is helping small business accelerate, mainly through access to kitchen space. Kitchen space is really expensive in New York, especially for small businesses when you just need some pots, pans, and a stove. Jessamyn provides that infrastructure at a subsidized rate for community members in Harlem. HBK is close to the heart for me and my partners because we actually started Hella out of their facility in 2012. They solved our problem of not being able to access capital for infrastructure - had we used the capital we had for product on infrastructure, it would have been a wrap for us. HBK gave us exactly what we needed to get off the ground.\n\n![ABC Cocina](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jomaree%20Pinkard%20ABC%20Kitchen.jpg)\n## ABC Cocina\nABC Cocina is where we have all of our celebrations whenever we hit a milestone. It’s where we take clients when something amazing happens...it’s just an incredible hospitality space. We love having a relationship with the ABC guys because they represent the standard of quality and hospitality that we aspire to with Hella. Getting them as a partner was a big stamp of approval, a really significant cosign, for us. They’re the shit when it comes to food, design, again, hospitality, and just thinking about how the whole experience needs to come together.

The idea behind Story is that it’s run like a magazine - the theme behind the store changes up every 8 to 12 weeks. So one week, you might have a story that’s all about yoga or wellness, whereas right now the whole thing is built out to promote the show Mr. Robot. Everything that’s sold in the store during that window will somehow reflect the theme. For us, Story and Rachel have been great because they’ll let us get involved from an events standpoint, where we’ll run the bar for her, and from a retail perspective if the theme is relevant to Hella. We spend a lot of time there building relationships through Rachel - for example, she’s one of the primary reasons we were featured in the American Express commercial. We met the team at one of her events.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nSupporting independent businesses is crucial because most businesses in the world are small and independent. Without small businesses, you don’t have the United States of America. You don’t have today’s economy. You don’t have people with jobs - the majority of people who are employed today work for small businesses. Even big businesses acquire small businesses to keep growing - so nothing that we do can exist without that initial inspiration, that motivation of individuals coming together to start independent businesses. The ecosystem just doesn’t work - it can’t sustain or balance itself - unless you support small, independent businesses.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jomaree%20Pinkard%20Hot%20Bread%20Kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"Hot Bread Kitchen\"><h2 id=\"hot-bread-kitchen\">Hot Bread Kitchen</h2>\n<p>So we’re in Harlem at HBK - Hot Bread Kitchen - which was started by an amazing woman named Jessamyn Rodriguez.

Skip ahead 15 years and we find out (through random coincidence) that we'd been living a block away from each other in Park Slope without knowing it. Andrea was planning to open an Italian restaurant right on our corner in a space that had been boarded up for decades. I was so happy to hear that one of my oldest friends would be creating a neighborhood gem for everyone to hang out in, filled with all my favorite Andrea recipes and family memorabilia from Sicily. To contribute to the ambiance, I made a handful of small paintings that grace the walls of the dining room - it makes me very happy to see them there whenever I walk past Hugo & Sons every morning.

I think I had passed by it a couple of times prior but, to be honest, ice cream was never really something I was a fiend for. One trip to Ample Hills changed that forever. While everyone else is busy making rose petal infused bullshit Ample Hills is cranking out the real deal...smooth, creamy, and full of amazing mix-ins. We got so obsessed with Ample Hills that Maayan bought me an ice cream maker and the Ample Hills cookbook for my birthday last year. We've been experimenting with our own flavors - so far, \"Easter Sundae\" & \"MILF Chocolate\" have been real crowd pleasers.\n\n![Lation Jewelry](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Maayan%20Zilberman%20and%20Alex%20Burns%20Latino%20Jewelry.jpg)\n## Latino Jewelry\nM: When I was little, my grandparents gave me a nameplate necklace in Hebrew from a guy in the market in Jerusalem. I've worn it since - originally, it dangled by my rib cage and now it sits right above my collarbone. I got an updated one a few years ago from the same market in a new font. When I moved to NYC in the 90s I noticed all the girls downtown wearing gold nameplates...I always wanted wanted one to encapsulate this important stage in my life but I didn't know where to go, or if having a THIRD \"Maayan\" would put it over the edge. Enter Mr. Burns...\n\nA: When I was growing up in New York, one of the ways you stayed fresh was with custom jewelry: name plates, belt buckles, door knockers, gold fronts. Canal St was the Mecca for custom gold jewelry and Latino Jewelers is a Canal St. gold spot that operates in the classic New York tradition. Cases and cases of chains, rings, earrings - whatever you want, they can do it. I wanted to get something for Maayan that would evoke the classic 90's era that I know she loves and let everyone know who she was with...hence the \"I'm with Burns\" nameplate in the classic baseball script. These days, there are fewer and fewer stores like Latino Jewelers on Canal (or anywhere for that matter), but there's really no substitute for the original Canal St. experience. If you go by Latino, ask for Tommy and tell'em Burns sent ya. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nM: My favorite thing to do in this city is to walk around and explore small shops and talk to business owners. What makes NYC so special is how you can come here with a particular talent, set up shop, and make a living in such close proximity to others who share your passion. Over the last few years, as I've taken walks through my favorite neighborhoods, I've noticed fewer and fewer of these businesses and more and more banks and pharmacies moving in to take their place. While I understand that times change, I can't stress enough how important it is for us to show our fellow independent businesses support - keeping them here is keeping the NYC spirit we know and love alive. \n\nA: As someone who grew up in New York, I've seen a tremendous amount of change occur over the last 30 years. New York will always be an amazing, vibrant city and people from all over the world will always be drawn here. I do think, however, that in some ways New York has become a victim of its own success, particularly when it comes to the cost of doing business and the cost of living. More than ever, it’s becoming impossibly difficult for small business owners to really stand a chance. \n\nIt's a cliche at this point, but every time a local business closes down, I wonder what national chain will move into that space. The real tragedy is the loss of culture; endangering small businesses homogenizes the culture of New York City. When people around the world allow big corporations to decide on and standardize products available to them, visiting other places becomes irrelevant. Small businesses represent the creative consciousness - they contribute tremendously to the unique identities of communities everywhere.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Maayan%20Zilberman%20and%20Alex%20Burns%20Hugo.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo\"><h2 id=\"hugo-sons\">Hugo &amp; Sons</h2>\n<p>M: I&#39;ve been friends with the owners of Hugo &amp; Sons, Andrea and Rebecca, since art school, where Andrea and I were studio neighbors.

My relationship with independent businesses is that if I&#39;m allowed to feel like a regular, I&#39;ll never ever go away. There are other thrift stores, but I&#39;d never go to another first, Bc the employees have always made me feel appreciated, have entertained my dumb conversations, and have been forced to watch me get on the most absurd outfits imaginable.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/RembertBrowneExley.jpg\" alt=\"The Exley\"><h2 id=\"the-exley\">The Exley</h2>\n<p>This is my bar, my restaurant, the place I charge my phone, the place i laugh, the place I cry, the place I accidentally forget to close out or leave my bag but then get a text saying my stuff is fine, the place I show up to in flip flops, the place I&#39;ll swing by just to see if anyone needs anything from the bodega, the place I start my night, and the place I end my night.</p><p>It&#39;s the definition of an independent neighborhood establishment.

They have, amongst other items, the absolute best baby goat in the spring. I still go there for myself and on behalf of the restaurant. Anyways, while I was exploring these stores along the avenue, I thought to myself, “wow, these people - all they care about is maintaining tradition and community in this neighborhood.” There was something so refreshing and touching about that.\n\nThe point is, any independent business is rooted in the community around it. The culture and community have to embrace you - they have to feel that you’re important to them - before you can grow and expand. This applies whether you’re a coffee shop, a restaurant, or anything else.

One day George's friend was helping him fix the railing on his stairs when the dude walks by and grabs some shit out of his boy’s toolbox and slickly walks on by. Without missing a beat, George's friend runs up behind him and bops him on the head with the wrench he already had in his hand. The dude just laid there for half an hour before getting up and stumbling away. That story has nothing to do with Nelly's Flower Shop, an oddly triangle-shaped but beautiful greenhouse oasis that's basically underneath the Lorimer J train in South Williamsburg. They do all sorts of flower arrangements for holidays, funerals, and apologizing for being a dick to your spouse stuff but I think the real gem is the wide selection of live plants and trees in this place. I bought a highly fragrant Meyer lemon tree here that's still regularly dropping citrus that I let get wrinkly and gross in a basket. This place has been open here since 1971, lord knows the kind of crazy hijinx they've witnessed over the years (being located directly adjacent to the 90th precinct probably helps though.) \n\n![To The World Farm](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Dap%20To%20The%20World%20Farm.jpg)\n## To The World Farm \nThis Korean-run produce and grocery store has been running for more than 20 years on Grand Street in Williamsburg. It's located next to an Associated supermarket whose paltry produce selections pale in comparison. The owner and the staff are unbelievably nice and helpful. They're also all very good-looking. I've been wanting for years to ask f they're related but I'm afraid of sounding racist. A solid selection produce, cheap and fresh herbs, along with tofu and homemade kimchi makes this spot worth a visit. They started juicing not too long ago, and they have the biggest and cheapest wheatgrass shot in town. If you're a regular they also let you run a tab! A TAB! Try that at a supermarket!\n\n![Spoonbill & Sugartown, Booksellers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Dap%20Spoonbill%20and%20Sugartown.jpg)\n## Spoonbill & Sugartown, Booksellers \nThe second outpost of this Williamsburg institution (the original branch on Bedford Avenue opened in 1999, making it an institution in this neighborhood) opened on the ground floor of my building. The selection is immaculate and well thought-out and the way the store is laid out makes it a real haven for smartypants, eccentrics, perverts, and regulars. My man Jonas is also pretty cool about doing events in there, I'll be sure to have my short story collection release gala there as soon as possible, folks. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nI'm from Queens, but I've lived on this one block, more on than off, for ten years. I lived on the other side of the block ten years ago. I used to be able to see the room I was being an idiot in when I was 22 from my kitchen window until a year ago when the building was predictably demolished to make way for a hideous condo.  This neighborhood is increasingly swarming with transient, transplant garbage from the rest of America who want to change their parts of the neighborhood before they even get to know it. Many refuse to integratt or interact with local businesses and people. Or they use their cash reserves to force their own uninspired and played-out boutiques, bars, and coffee shops onto the streetscape. \n\nThe Southside, through strong community organizations, has been able to resist the level of onslaught seen in the neighborhood's Northside. At a recent community board meeting I heard the lawyer of a yet-to-open coffeeshop (the 4th in a 3 block vicinity!) vying for a liquor license threaten to override the church across the street and the community's resistance to their 4 AM closing time by appealing directly to the state liquor board in Harlem. They claimed to be opening a \"neighborhood gathering spot\" too. Whose neighborhood? Definitely not the one saying they don't want another bar for white kids from the Midwest to be boring in. \n\nDiverse, independent small businesses give the city it's unique and (disappearing) character. The more corporate and outside forces make it untenable for people from the city to keep themselves and their business here, the less worthwhile and interesting a city to live in this becomes. Support your local businesses and participate in local politics. at the very least throw rocks through glass condominium windows at night. If not, we can watch all the great things about the city's neighborhoods get up and stumble away like so many toolbox thieves in the night.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Dap%20Nelly&#39;s.jpg\" alt=\"Nelly&#39;s\"><h2 id=\"nelly-s\">Nelly&#39;s</h2>\n<p>My neighbor George tells the story of a neighborhood tough guy who used to walk down the block in the early eighties and steal anything that wasn&#39;t bolted down: people&#39;s groceries, cars, mail, whatever.

Mizu on 59th and Park is a small, very New York City hairdresser - it’s standalone and not part of any kind of chain or franchise. Mizu is great because it’s truly a local business; the people who work there all live in the city. They employ something like thirty to forty people if you count the hairdressers who make their own hours and don’t work there full time. There are other hairdressers I’ll occasionally go to, but Mizu is close to me - it’s very convenient, I’m accustomed to it, and the services are good.\n\n## Primola\nPrimola is a small, independently owned establishment on 2nd Ave between 64th and 65th. The gentleman who owns the place knows everybody who comes in, the food is always good, and whenever I walk in I’ll see at least a few people I know from the area. It’s impressive when a restaurant in this city can sustain itself for so long. As everyone knows, there are so many new restaurants that open up in the city every week...they’ll be hot for the first few months and nobody can get in, and then within one or two years most of them are gone. So it’s great to find ones that have solid legs beneath them. If you really want to start a restaurant in New York City, my advice would be to understand the neighborhood you’re in so you can carve out a niche that makes sense. Make it work for the neighborhood first, not the other way around. Bigger isn’t always better.\n\n## Mme Eleanor’s Cleaners\nMme Eleanor’s is on 53rd and 1st. Again, it’s another one of these small, very specialized, and independently operated business that keep the city thriving. I’ve been going to them for over 30 years. It’s in the neighborhood, their turnaround and work ethic is good, so everything either goes to them or one other specialty cleaner that I use. Convenience is another big factor, but I’m not talking about the kind of convenience that you get with, say, an Amazon. Amazon brings convenience that has a lot of destructive side effects - the convenience that you get at something like Mme Eleanor’s is one that’s rooted in personal connection and familiarity.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nTwo things that really impacted small businesses in New York City were 9-11 and the downturn of 2008. These events completely changed people’s idea of what coming into the city meant. Quite frankly, a lot of people were frightened at that time and they slipped into this pattern of staying where they were...in Jersey or Connecticut - or even the outer boroughs - and small businesses experienced a lot of fallout from that.\n\nI think what people have to remember is that you don’t get the same level of personalized connection and services with larger, chain businesses. There’s incomparable value to knowing the people you’re doing business with. That relationship affords you a level of service and convenience that you’ll never find at a big franchise. As a society, we’ve become so focused on our phones, on automation, on “efficiency,” on optimization, that we’ve started to lose a little bit of our humanity. I really do feel that it’s an ironically dark age that we’re in because of this. You know, I’m in the live events business, so it’s become increasingly clear to me that we’re one of the last ways and reasons for people to come together in real life and bond over something they all relate to. That’s a strange thing for me to consider, but I’ll always fight for that experience to thrive and be a part of our culture.

Living in a densely populated residential neighborhood in a busy city, we of course had access to a lot of other food markets, but Zabar’s has always had a special place in our hearts given the deep Upper West Side roots - the fact that it has been family-owned and operated since founding (by other native UWS-ers!), and our moms’ regular visits to bring us the best of the best on Sunday mornings. When our friends from out of town visit and want an authentic New York bagel, Zabar’s is at the top of the list.\n\n![Cafe Grumpy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jordana%20Kier%20and%20Alexandra%20Friedman%20Cafe%20Grumpy.jpg)\n## Cafe Grumpy\nCafe Grumpy is the antithesis to a big coffeeshop chain, which is exactly why we love it! Stepping into Grumpy is like putting our lives on pause for a brief moment, which rarely happens these days. Grumpy doesn’t allow laptops and has a bunch of newspapers available for its patrons. The baristas know our names and our drink of choice, and there’s always a delicious pastry selection behind the counter. Here, we’re able to take a deep breath, enjoy a great cup of coffee, and disconnect from our digital lives, which is a real luxury. Grumpy truly reminds us to stop and smell the… you know.\n\n![The Sill](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jordana%20Kier%20and%20Alexandra%20Friedman%20The%20Sill.jpg)\n## The Sill\nThe Sill holds a special place in our hearts because it made us both “plant people.” Neither of us had ever had a plant on our desk before, and then suddenly we had the option to get THE most adorable plants delivered to us in the cutest pots ever (bright and festive, yet simple). The Sill lends a country vibe to city living and enabled us to have a connection to the outdoors even when we’re stuck in our office all week. Every plant is potted and designed with love - it’s not the kind of individualized attention that you can get from a big corporation. We’re also huge fans of The Sill’s founder, Eliza Blank, who gets her hands dirty every day in her greenhouse and manages a large, passionate, and diverse team of plant-lovers who adore working for her.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nThere are so many reasons! Independent businesses bring unique character and authenticity to communities, which is particularly important in a city of skyscrapers and over 8 million people like New York City. They are also critical for sustaining local economies, recycling larger shares of their revenue back into their community, creating more jobs, and strengthening communities' social and economic relationships. For us, we'd prefer to shop local because it gives us peace of mind knowing that we're supporting other entrepreneurs and giving back to the same members of the community who have supported us. The passion of these businesses and their owners help drive our economy forward, and it's very important that we continue to support them.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jordana%20Kier%20and%20Alexandra%20Friedman%20Zabar&#39;s.jpg\" alt=\"Zabars\"><h2 id=\"zabar-s\">Zabar&#39;s</h2>\n<p>As native Upper West Siders, we both grew up eating Zabar’s every week: bagels, lox, cheese, coffee, olives, breads, everything delicious.

As far as we’re concerned, this is the most epic studio in New York City. Dune is actually way more than just a studio to us, though - they’re true partners of ours. Anytime you’re in here you’ll see that they’ve got huge corporate clients - everyone from Bloomingdale’s to Neiman are shooting today - but they don’t lose sight of giving young brands opportunities to grow. As it pertains to Rochambeau, they’ve always provided us with studio space, equipment for photo shoots - without their support , we wouldn’t exist.  \n\nJ: We really became family when Dune took a bunch of space at 121 Varick Street, which is essentially home base for both of our companies. We met the owner in the hallway while he was moving in - best energy on Earth  - and like Laurence just said, he’s built a massive business but has always remained humble and continues to take care of the little guys. Whether it’s because he liked our aesthetic or saw something in our hustle, he’s done us so many favors since we first linked up with him. So we try and repay that every chance we get.  \n\n![Hauser & Wirth](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Laurence%20Chandler%20and%20Joshua%20Cooper%20Hauser%20and%20Wirth.jpg)\n## Hauser & Wirth\nL: Hauser & Wirth is arguably the best gallery in New York City, and, more recently, LA. The thing that makes Hauser unique is that, although they have the most incredible, endless roster of artists (everyone from Paul McCarthy to Rashid Johnson) and their spaces are so large scale, they never forget to keep their eye on what’s happening with the younger generation.\n\nWe have a great friend named Yuta over at Hauser - I’ve had the fortune of watching him go from employee to his current position as co-director. What they’ve allowed Yuta to do is take their 69th street townhouse or the back room of their 19th street space and curate shows for and by younger artists. By trusting their team’s vision and empowering them to take risks, Hauser elevates itself above the conversations other galleries and institutions are having. It’s a really smart, inspiring way of doing business - young curators accrue a bunch of experience while leaning on Hauser’s reputation and network just as Hauser benefits from housing these cutting edge points of view. \n\n![Balthazar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Laurence%20Chandler%20and%20Joshua%20Cooper%20Balthazar.jpg)\n## Balthazar\nL: Balthazar is the best restaurant in New York City. No contest. If someone tries to argue that, they just don’t know New York City restaurants well enough. They’re part of the incredible lineage of establishments throughout New York like The Odeon, Lucky Strike, Schiller’s - all of the McNally properties lead up to the mecca that is Balthazar. \n\nIn a city where restaurants turn over on a weekly basis, Balthazar is as close to a permanent institution as you can find. Of course, the most important thing here is the relationship you have with the bar staff. While a table is covetable, a seat at the bar almost means more. Our guy Willis is the person we always look to for the best dirty martini in Manhattan - he’ll always set us up regardless of how overridden the place is with tourists or if it’s holiday season. Take care of your bar staff - that’s one of the most important relationships you’ll ever have in New York.\n\nJ: Balthazar’s a rare constant. Obviously, we both drink a lot, so knowing that there’s a dependable dirty martini somewhere is crucial. When you’ve lived here as long as we have, you see all the hype pass. When you’re younger, you hit all the new spots, but at a certain point you realize there’s a distinction between quality and trends. I’ve always felt at home at Balthazar because it’s so consistent - you’ll never have a bad meal (whether it’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner), a bad experience with a waiter...everything is permanently locked at the highest level. Like Laurence said, it’s one of those places that reminds you to take care of the people who take care of you. \n\nL: Actually, the most important thing about Balthazar is that you might run into Pam Anderson.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nJ: This city defines Do or Die - there is simply no way that you can make it here without having a strong network of partners, friends, and supporters you can depend on. So it’s essential that you keep your word and look out for the people who help you. Pushing independent businesses forward evolves culture. There are enough massive companies out there that eat off our communities’ plates - without supporting each other, we’d completely fall prey to that. \n\nL:Yeah,  I don’t buy into all the bitching and criticisms about, “oh, New York is dying. New York is changing.” New York is always going to be the center of the world. And a big part of why that’s true is because of the independent businesses in our city. As proprietors of a handful of businesses ourselves, we know how important it is to create a sense of camaraderie with fellow entrepreneurs and loyalty amongst our customers. Relationships matter more than anything in distinguishing independent businesses from large-scale, corporate experiences. Knowing that you’re always welcome somewhere, having a first name relationship with owners of a place you frequent - that literally generates community and culture. And New York can only be as strong as we want both of those forces to be.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Laurence%20Chandler%20and%20Joshua%20Cooper%20Dune%20Studios.jpg\" alt=\"Dune Studios\"><h2 id=\"dune-studios\">Dune Studios</h2>\n<p>L: Right now, we’re here at Dune Studios’ new location at 55 Water prepping for our Spring Summer ‘17 fashion show.

I’m the biggest fan of their beef patties...if they ever stopped making beef patties I don’t think I could support them as a business anymore. Just joking! Those patties are seriously amazing, though - I don’t know how they make them but the Miss Lily’s patty is like an elevated version of the ones I’ve eaten my whole life...I almost compare it to a boeuf bourguignon. Seriously. The jerk chicken is great, too. I’ve been coming to Miss Lily’s since I moved to New York...it was one of the first places I ate at when I got to the city. Aside from the food being excellent, I think they do a great job of contributing and adding something that’s very needed to the neighborhoods around them.\n\n![Mulberry Iconic Magazines](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Didier%20Lerebours%20Mulberry%20Iconic%20Magazines.jpg)\n## Mulberry Iconic Magazines\n\nSo, I’m in the magazine and publication distribution business. Mulberry Iconic is one of the places I deal to (they stock publications I rep like Sneeze, Buffalo Zine, and Happy Reader) - I really enjoy working with the owners, Hamal and Tamal. These guys have been rocking with me since I was running my business out of a basement in Montreal...I called them randomly telling them about what I had on hand and they gave me a shot. They’re great clients who operate a few of the corner stores around the city that will have, you know, those massive and sort of random selections of niche, limited periodicals. I support those guys because they support me a lot - which is as simple a relationship as it gets. It’s a no-brainer, really. Anytime I’m in there, I’ll buy magazines just for myself or for a friend. Easy.\n\n![Dashwood Books](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Didier%20Lerebours%20Dashwood%20Books.jpg)\n## Dashwood Books\n\nDashwood isn’t a client of mine (as they don’t sell magazines), but I’m a big fan of their selection and have stopped by regularly since I moved to New York. They basically sell extremely hard-to-find books - all of your rare, out-of-print manuscripts, and generally whatever else no one seems to be able to get their hands on. Lots of signed books, as well. As I mentioned earlier, I’m in the magazine distribution business, but before anything professional I’m a fan of this culture. Rare books and publications fascinate me. So anyone or any business that represents that culture is something I’ll support til the end. I couldn’t tell you what precisely distinguishes Dashwood’s collection from other stores’ (like Mast or something like that), but as you look through what they have it’s easy to tell that their perspective is totally unique.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nIndependent businesses are the country’s primary economic engine. We drive the whole machine; we make it move forward. Besides that, though, independent businesses are exceptionally clear reflections of the dreams, goals, and vision of the people behind them. It’s really cool to be able to experience something that directly demonstrates how much work goes into making it tick every day. As an entrepreneur myself, being supportive of other independent businesses (in whatever ways I can) only helps me learn what I can do better with my own company. Lastly, and maybe most importantly, supporting a small business shows how you (as someone with his or her own identity) choose to vote with your hard-earned money.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Didier%20Lerebours%20Miss%20Lily&#39;s.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Lily&#39;s\"><h2 id=\"miss-lily-s\">Miss Lily’s</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about Miss Lily’s.

D’Amico Coffee on Court. Most people seem to be fans of medium coffee, but I always go in and get a pound of their house blend light. The D’Amico dudes are legendary because I’m always like, “you know you could charge double for this, right?” and they go, “oh, no, we don’t do that here.” Once you buy D’Amico, it’s hard to buy anything at other coffee spots. Authentic vibes and great people in there - enough said.\n\n## The Bike Truck\n\nYou can just tell that everyone at The Bike Truck are hard-working guys. All young, in their early to mid 20s, and really helpful - no question is too silly or dumb for them. They deserve all the business in the world. I think what really sets The Bike Truck apart from other shops is...well, it’s kind of similar to the thing that happens in certain record shops. Once in awhile, you’ll walk into a record shop and the person behind the counter is a total elitist, bumming people out because he’s better than everyone in the store. These guys are kind of the opposite - you could bring a busted tricycle or a unicycle in and they’d be like, “cool, let’s fix this thing, let’s figure it out.” Doesn’t matter what you got. There were other bike shops in the area that weren’t doing so hot on the customer service tip, so it’s great that The Bike Truck is here.\n\n## Boomwich\n\nBoomwich is on Atlantic - pretty close to my crib. The food is great there and they’re really price-sensitive, which is important to me and this community. They’re not trying to get over on you, so for me it’s a great addition to the neighborhood’s food options. You can get anything on the menu as a sandwich or salad. I always order a simple salad with turkey and, let me tell you, this isn’t your average, store-bought turkey. It’s juicy, moist, mom-cooked Thanksgiving cuts that deserve a chalice of gravy to accompany every slice. Order that and you’re set for at least two meals. Plus they have the janky iPod speaker or whatever dangling from the ceiling off some old chains...they’re always bumping old Snoop or something gangster.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nWell, with a food spot like Boomwich - because it’s a small operation, they can be more mindful of where they’re sourcing ingredients. That’s a plus both from a quality standpoint and from a helping-the-community perspective. With a place like D’Amico, you get that really incomparable, old school New York experience that can never be replicated in, say, a Starbucks or whatever. People know who you are, they know your order - how can you beat that level of personalization? And with The Bike Truck - sure, you could order parts online, but there’s an entirely different value to being able to walk into your local shop, get advice, and work with people you trust. These are all things that big businesses can’t deliver on, so if you care about stuff like that supporting independent businesses is essential.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"d-amico-coffee-roasters\">D’Amico Coffee Roasters</h2>\n<p>Man.

You knew of Orso because it was kind of The Theater’s Place to Be - all of the stars and producers were always eating there. One night, Meg and Fran took me to dinner at Orso. I remember every moment of that experience and thinking to myself, “I can’t wait until I can afford to come here on my own and bring people here.”\n\nWell, I’ve been a regular at Orso for about 20 years now and can safely say that I’ve had literally everything on the menu. Everything is consistently delicious. Additionally, it’s an establishment that’s really accommodating - I’ll have business meetings there, run in before heading to the theater, and regularly stop by with my family. The waiters have been there forever, the owners are the managers, everyone knows who you are, and we’ll always get a table when we need one. On top of all that, Orso’s in a fantastic location: it’s two blocks from my house on 44th, two blocks from my office on 43rd, and two blocks from every Broadway theater. While the convenience factor alone puts it over the top for me, what’s really amazing is that my entire family - whether it’s my wife, my kids, or my extended family - all of them absolutely love the food. It’s a great place to go at 6 o’clock before curtain, but also 11 o’clock after shows. Everything about Orso is a 10.\n\n![Domus](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bermie%20Telsey%20Domus.jpg)\n## Domus\nDomus is a store on 44th street between 9th and 10th - it’s diagonally across the street from where I live. I’ve been a customer there for over 15 years. Of course, I first walked in because I wanted to support businesses on my block, but over the years I’ve continued to buy things at Domus because they really fulfill so many of my needs. It’s run and owned by two women, Nicki and Luisa (both of whom I wish I hung out with more), who’ve got incredible taste and curatorial minds. Most of what is stocked at Domus are home goods made by women in foreign (often developing) nations. You can tell how committed Nicki and Luisa are just by thinking about how difficult it must be to support these women and import their wares to the States. In my mind, something about that dedication elevates Domus beyond what retail typically is; it’s about so much more than just facilitating transactions.\n\nI’ll always buy cards, baby gifts, and presents for family, friends, and clients at Domus. The greatest thing about the shop might be how much my dogs love it - at this point, it doesn’t matter what time I’m walking them. It could be 2 AM and if we’re anywhere close to Domus they’ll head right for the store and get upset that it’s closed.\n\n![Fresh Cut Flowers, Inc.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bernie%20Telsey%20Fresh%20Cut%20Flowers%20Inc.jpg)\n## Fresh Cut Flowers, Inc.\nFresh Cut Flowers is my neighborhood florist. It’s run by a guy named Robert, who’s another individual with an impeccable curatorial eye. I don’t know much about flowers besides the fact that my wife loves them and I appreciate them deeply on an aesthetic level. So while I might not know all of the names of every flower in the store, I can always call and they seem to intuitively know exactly what I need, whether it’s for a business thing or my home. I’ll say “I want something like this for something on Monday night - one that’s wild, one that’s red” and the most amazing bouquets will show up that are completely in line with what I had in mind. It’s surreal. I think that’s one of the greatest things about building a relationship with a local business - you develop a shorthand with the people who run it.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nBecause I live very close to where I work, I’m doubly conscious of supporting the people who run businesses in my neighborhood. I want independent business owners on my block to flourish because behind them are human beings who I depend on and have relationships with. I’d be heartbroken if they weren’t around. Independent businesses like Domus, Orso, and Fresh Cut Flowers make neighborhoods healthy; they ground them. They give communities vibrancy and provide neighbors with places to get together - there’s a real sense of security in that. I’ve said this several times throughout this interview, but it’s wonderful to be able to see how your patronage can help a business thrive - in dealing with an independent business owner, I feel like you usually get back even more than you give.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bernie%20Telsey%20Orso.jpg\" alt=\"Orso\"><h2 id=\"orso\">Orso</h2>\n<p>I remember the first time I went to Orso - I was working for Meg Simon and Fran Kumin right out of school as a casting assistant.

On top of all that, Orso’s in a fantastic location: it’s two blocks from my house on 44th, two blocks from my office on 43rd, and two blocks from every Broadway theater. While the convenience factor alone puts it over the top for me, what’s really amazing is that my entire family - whether it’s my wife, my kids, or my extended family - all of them absolutely love the food. It’s a great place to go at 6 o’clock before curtain, but also 11 o’clock after shows. Everything about Orso is a 10.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bermie%20Telsey%20Domus.jpg\" alt=\"Domus\"><h2 id=\"domus\">Domus</h2>\n<p>Domus is a store on 44th street between 9th and 10th - it’s diagonally across the street from where I live. I’ve been a customer there for over 15 years. Of course, I first walked in because I wanted to support businesses on my block, but over the years I’ve continued to buy things at Domus because they really fulfill so many of my needs. It’s run and owned by two women, Nicki and Luisa (both of whom I wish I hung out with more), who’ve got incredible taste and curatorial minds. Most of what is stocked at Domus are home goods made by women in foreign (often developing) nations. You can tell how committed Nicki and Luisa are just by thinking about how difficult it must be to support these women and import their wares to the States. In my mind, something about that dedication elevates Domus beyond what retail typically is; it’s about so much more than just facilitating transactions.</p><p>I’ll always buy cards, baby gifts, and presents for family, friends, and clients at Domus. The greatest thing about the shop might be how much my dogs love it - at this point, it doesn’t matter what time I’m walking them. It could be 2 AM and if we’re anywhere close to Domus they’ll head right for the store and get upset that it’s closed.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bernie%20Telsey%20Fresh%20Cut%20Flowers%20Inc.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh Cut Flowers, Inc.\"><h2 id=\"fresh-cut-flowers-inc-\">Fresh Cut Flowers, Inc.</h2>\n<p>Fresh Cut Flowers is my neighborhood florist. It’s run by a guy named Robert, who’s another individual with an impeccable curatorial eye. I don’t know much about flowers besides the fact that my wife loves them and I appreciate them deeply on an aesthetic level. So while I might not know all of the names of every flower in the store, I can always call and they seem to intuitively know exactly what I need, whether it’s for a business thing or my home. I’ll say “I want something like this for something on Monday night - one that’s wild, one that’s red” and the most amazing bouquets will show up that are completely in line with what I had in mind. It’s surreal. I think that’s one of the greatest things about building a relationship with a local business - you develop a shorthand with the people who run it.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>Because I live very close to where I work, I’m doubly conscious of supporting the people who run businesses in my neighborhood. I want independent business owners on my block to flourish because behind them are human beings who I depend on and have relationships with. I’d be heartbroken if they weren’t around. Independent businesses like Domus, Orso, and Fresh Cut Flowers make neighborhoods healthy; they ground them. They give communities vibrancy and provide neighbors with places to get together - there’s a real sense of security in that. I’ve said this several times throughout this interview, but it’s wonderful to be able to see how your patronage can help a business thrive - in dealing with an independent business owner, I feel like you usually get back even more than you give.</p>","date":"2016-07-08 09:38 -0400","published":true,"title":"Bernie Telsey","description":"founder - <a href=\"http://www.telseyandco.com/\">Telsey + Company</a>","category":"favorites","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bernie%20Telsey%20Main%20Portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Bernie Telsey","socialBlurb":"Bernie Telsey shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@telseyandco shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC with @onbondstreet"},{"name":"chris-altchek","markdown":"---\ndate: '2016-06-30 09:08 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Chris Altchek\ndescription: 'Co-founder - <a href=\"https://mic.com/\">Mic</a>'\ncategory: favorites\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Chris%20Altchek%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Chris Altchek'\nsocialBlurb: Chris Altchek of Mic shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: >-\n  .@caltchek of @mic shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC  with\n  @onbondstreet\n---\n## Master Bike Shop\n\nMaster Bike Shop is on 72nd and Broadway, which is really close to my apartment. It’s a cool place that was introduced to me by a friend on our cycling team. Anytime you crash your bike or you need to get something repaired, these guys have the answers - they have their craft down to a science. It’s important that you trust whoever is repairing your bike - the last thing you want when you’re barreling down a hill at 50 miles an hour is for your fork to break or your tire to fall off. Half of the guys there don’t speak English, but when you watch them work it’s clear that you don’t need to explain anything to them - Master is a totally appropriate name for this shop.\n\n## P&K Laundromat\n\nI travel a lot and am always out of clean clothes, so my second spot is P&K Laundromat. I can’t count the number of times this place has stayed open late for me. I’m pretty sure the manager works on-site seven days a week, is always super pleasant to be around, and knows both me and my girlfriend by name. That’s an experience that’s pretty unique to local businesses.\n\n## Oaxaca\nMy third spot is Oaxaca, our neighborhood taqueria. My girlfriend is a resident, so whenever she’s away or working late, I’m there every night for some pretty long stretches. Everyone there is really friendly - I’ll usually pick up or eat there, but the best thing about Oaxaca is that they’ll always deliver to my apartment even though I live a block away. Good value, great people, awesome food, and convenience - you can’t beat it.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nI live in New York because I love New York, and a big part of what makes this city so great are its people and businesses. Local businesses afford you the opportunity to interact with people you otherwise wouldn’t connect with in your daily life or at your job. Having those personal interactions is what makes this city feel real to me. I’m lucky to have a lot of independent businesses in my neighborhood - they’re what makes living on the Upper West Side great.

From the design that was done by a great friend of mine, [Lotta](http://www.okreal.co/articles/lotta-nieminen/), to our partners (who are both fellow New Zealanders) - everything was made possible by people we’re close to. All of this started because we couldn’t find great coffee in New York six years ago. That might be hard to believe now, but back then there weren’t a lot of options. Being from New Zealand - where coffee culture is a huge part of our lives - we decided to try and bring that vibe to the city. That’s why we sell flat whites and so on. As far as the design is concerned, all of us wanted to get away from that rustic, artisanal aesthetic that you find all over the place, so we went with a fresh, industrial, and minimalist approach to the shop. Mainly, we care that the team is made up of solid people. You can find someone who’s an incredible barista, but if they suck as a person, what’s the point? You can teach someone how to make good coffee, but you can’t teach a good attitude.

It’s my low-key escape zone. If I had to put my finger on it, I’d have to say it’s between their unbeatable curation and that it still feels like a remnant of the old New York. They’ll always have a book in there that Patti Smith sneezed on or something so it’s worth a million dollars - really rare stuff that you can’t dig up anywhere else. Because my thing has always been creative writing, I’ll normally make a beeline for their poetry collection.

If people in your neighborhood are working hard to make something great happen, you choosing to buy a coffee at their shop instead of Starbucks, or taking a class with them instead of at an Equinox - it’s directly helping them achieve their dreams.

I always try to make sure we have a team entered in the tournament, because the Summer would not be the same without one. The tournament brings the best basketball players in the city to this small court in the village. I started coming down to West 4th when I was 12 or 13 and I am 31 years old now. I probably learned more about business and decision making from just hanging out here and observing different people and situations. Two of my prior businesses were actually birthed at the court. West 4th is a lot of things from the talented players of the tournament, to the urban theater of the pick up games, to the hustling on the handball courts, but it is definitely a New York institution. You'd be surprised how valuable the lessons I learned(good and bad) taught by guys named Butter, Rookie, and Heavy are when scaling a business. \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls\". \n\n![Supreme](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Joey_Goodwin_Supreme.jpg)\n## Supreme \nSupreme is a huge inspiration for Overthrow.

The tournament brings the best basketball players in the city to this small court in the village. I started coming down to West 4th when I was 12 or 13 and I am 31 years old now. I probably learned more about business and decision making from just hanging out here and observing different people and situations. Two of my prior businesses were actually birthed at the court. West 4th is a lot of things from the talented players of the tournament, to the urban theater of the pick up games, to the hustling on the handball courts, but it is definitely a New York institution. You&#39;d be surprised how valuable the lessons I learned(good and bad) taught by guys named Butter, Rookie, and Heavy are when scaling a business. &quot;The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls&quot;. </p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Joey_Goodwin_Supreme.jpg\" alt=\"Supreme\"><h2 id=\"supreme\">Supreme</h2>\n<p>Supreme is a huge inspiration for Overthrow.

Then you’ll find like, random surgical tools or hardware...just anything imaginable. But the thing is, again, her curation is so careful and unique.

It’s just absolutely nuts and so few people seem to know about it. That store is one of the most insane tactile experiences in the city. They weave their own fabrics and hand sew them into the craziest, most fucked up pieces...then I think they must like, wash each piece a hundred times or something. Everything looks like a relic - so cool. It’s such an underrated spot. Part of why I love 45 RPM so much is that it’s such a secret hidden in plain sight. Mercer’s a busy street! The whole scent that fills that space up, plus the dim gallery lighting combined with the insane hospitality makes the store that much weirder of an experience. Any detail you look at in there is going to be on some other shit - the flooring, the buttons on the counter...it’s all so different from anything you’d expect or be used to. It’s so well thought out. \n\n## Wu Lim Services\nWu Lim is a massage spot on Grand. You walk down the staircase into this basement and there’s this room with like 20-25 massage tables. Just out in the open. There aren’t any screens or partitions for you to change behind, so you don’t get undressed. Or you do get undressed. I’ve done it. ...Depending on what I’m wearing. (Laughs) And yeah...it’s like $34 for like 46 minutes, something weirdly specific like that. They just go. At. You. They’re all crazy strong. My advice is to start on your stomach because they’ll put paper towels around the face ring, so if you END face down...when you walk out into the daylight you’re doing that with crazy paper towel marks in your face. I’d tell you who my favorite person is, but I can’t really be sharing her, so, sorry. They’re the best. And if you don’t believe me, John, our showroom manager, walked in and he said Adrian Brody was in there.

I’ve been in the inner workings of an independent business for 11 years with BDDW...I’ve done everything from fix the toilets to fulfill payroll. So I know how much other people who run their own companies go through on a day to day basis, right? I know what the entire spectrum of tasks and concerns they have to juggle looks and feels like.

Their selection of cactii and succulents is extensive and being inside the shop is like dropping into an actual jungle. I go a lot of times just to browse and surround myself with good vibes. The best part of Noble is the owner, who’s so connected to his plants that he’ll talk to you about them as if they're sentient beings. It almost feels like he's letting you buy one of his personal plants because he’s so meticulous about making sure that it's going to a good home (in the sense that he doesn't bullshit about what they need). He'll straight up tell you the plant will probably die in that cave you call an apartment, considering your excuse for “natural light” is the depressing shaft of sunshine that wiggles its way through two buildings into your living room for one hour a day.\n\n![Rock Star Crystals](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bec%20Brittain%20Rock%20Star%20Crystals%20Main.jpg)\n## Rock Star Crystals\nI like Rock Star because their collection really runs the gamut from little chunks of rocks for $1 to $1500, huge crystal geodes that looks like The Wall in Game of Thrones with the wildings coming to attack it. I sometimes come here to shop when I need to satisfy my hippie inclinations; I’ll get some crystals to tune the vibes in my house properly, and other times it's just about looking at amazing structures and minerals.  \n\n![Kidding Around](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Bec%20Brittain%20Kidding%20Around.jpg)\n## Kidding Around\nSo I admit it - I'm pretty much an internet shopper.

Kidding Around, however, is one of those places that is so much better than any internet shopping experience, if only because their edit of toys is so excellent that I’m willing to concede they’ve already done the work of finding the good stuff.

I’ve known the second-generation owner, John, for years. He lives in the building above the store and makes jerky using a family recipe that his mother came up with. In a way, Jung’s family-owned legacy reminds me of Nom Wah’s. On top of that, the product is just great. It’s made fresh daily in small batches - Jung’s was basically artisanal before artisanal became a thing. We just rotated it out, but for over a year we used his beef jerky at Fung Tu - we’d pair it with roasted peanuts as a bar snack. That was a big hit with everyone.\n\n![Wing Wong Bakery](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/WilsonTangWingWongBakery_w1280.jpg)\n\n## Wing Wong Bakery\n\nWing Wong Bakery’s been around for more than fifteen years. I remember it vividly because it’s right by my parents’ building on Allen, right around the corner. So Wing Wong was where I’d go every morning to pick up pastries and coffee. Nothing’s changed - it’s basically looked the same for the past two decades. I used to have a bakery back in 2005, so during those days I’d swing by Wing Wong to pick up tips about baking, how to make food last longer, how to brew coffee right - all of those are great memories that I hold onto.\n\n![Fong On](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/WilsonTangFongOn_w1280.jpg)\n\n## Fong On\n\nFong On is a family business that’s been here since the early 1900s. The current, second-generation owner, David, inherited the operation from his dad. The place we stopped by is their factory on Division, but they also have a retail location on Mott between Bayard and Pell - they own the whole building. We use a variety of David’s products at both Nom Wah and Fung Tu. For Fong Tu, we use the actual ho fun (rice noodle) in our stir fry mixed in with locally sourced chorizo and bean sprouts. At Nom Wah we use their liquid rice for chow fun. I’ve been going to all three of these places since I was a kid, so to be able to support them as an adult really brings everything full circle.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nI think independent businesses are the lifeline of every community. For example: Chinese food. New York City is a distribution hub for all Chinese restaurants along the eastern seaboard. There are literally thousands of shipping routes extending from New York that stretch up to Maine and go all the way down to Florida. Everyone relies on that supply chain, so in a sense it’s these independent purveyors that are responsible for keeping countless restaurants across the country operational. Additionally, I support businesses like Fong On and Jung’s because they’re making food in a way that’s disappearing from our collective memory. Once these businesses fade out, the craft goes with them. So supporting these businesses is essentially an act of preserving our culture.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/WilsonTangJungsJerky_w1280.jpg\" alt=\"Jung&#39;s Jerky\"><h2 id=\"jung-s-jerky\">Jung’s Jerky</h2>\n<p>Jung’s has been around forever - it’s a long-standing, old school Chinatown business.

This place is fiercely loved by many in New York’s arts / tech community.\n\nI first stumbled in here off a recommendation from my friend and collaborator Adam Harvey, when I was working on my first installation. Canal Plastic Center stocks a wealth of plastics, vinyl of all kinds, and it also has that dingy Cantonese-run charm to it. You can really trip out looking at the textures and reflections here - it’s a sugar rush of eye candy and material inspiration while you’re ideating on new projects.\n\n![Sun's Organic Garden Tea Shop](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sougwen%20Chung%20Main%20Portrait.jpeg)\n## Sun’s Organic Garden Tea Shop\nIn an alternate universe, I would be an older Asian lady with a tea shop in Chinatown just like this one. There’s something about this shop that I find very special; you can tell it’s the shop owner’s own sanctuary, not just a store. There’s an impressive variety of teas in large glass canisters - both traditional and medicinal - with hand written labels and “Do Not Touch!” warnings on every single one. I’ve come here before and asked for custom blends, and she mixes them by hand for you. It’s a bit of zen tucked away in New York’s otherwise raucous Chinatown. Definitely stop by...but don’t ask for Bubble Tea. They don’t mess with that here.\n\n![Spoonbill & Sugartown](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sougwen%20Chung%20Spoonbill%20Books.jpeg)\n## Spoonbill & Sugartown\nSpoonbill & Sugartown is a Williamsburg staple. I’ve spent hours here perusing the collection, and it also makes for a great meeting spot for perpetually tardy friends (of which I am one.) It can be financially dangerous to spend too much time at Spoonbill, but I’ve found some real gems for my collection while sifting aimlessly through the racks.  \n\n## Why is it important to support small businesses?\nSmall businesses are the bedrock of entrepreneurship. They make up the tapestry of a city; in New York in particular they are an essential part of what makes our creative ecosystem as vibrant as it is. On a personal note, I’m always attracted to the specific details that make an independent business tick...the smallest design flourishes and idiosyncrasies that make a space feel familiar.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sougwen%20Chung%20Canal%20Plastics.jpeg\" alt=\"Canal Plastic Center\"><h2 id=\"canal-plastic-center\">Canal Plastic Center</h2>\n<p>To me, one of the draws of New York is how fragmented it is.

You can really trip out looking at the textures and reflections here - it’s a sugar rush of eye candy and material inspiration while you’re ideating on new projects.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sougwen%20Chung%20Main%20Portrait.jpeg\" alt=\"Sun&#39;s Organic Garden Tea Shop\"><h2 id=\"sun-s-organic-garden-tea-shop\">Sun’s Organic Garden Tea Shop</h2>\n<p>In an alternate universe, I would be an older Asian lady with a tea shop in Chinatown just like this one. There’s something about this shop that I find very special; you can tell it’s the shop owner’s own sanctuary, not just a store. There’s an impressive variety of teas in large glass canisters - both traditional and medicinal - with hand written labels and “Do Not Touch!” warnings on every single one. I’ve come here before and asked for custom blends, and she mixes them by hand for you. It’s a bit of zen tucked away in New York’s otherwise raucous Chinatown. Definitely stop by...but don’t ask for Bubble Tea. They don’t mess with that here.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sougwen%20Chung%20Spoonbill%20Books.jpeg\" alt=\"Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown\"><h2 id=\"spoonbill-sugartown\">Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown</h2>\n<p>Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown is a Williamsburg staple. I’ve spent hours here perusing the collection, and it also makes for a great meeting spot for perpetually tardy friends (of which I am one.) It can be financially dangerous to spend too much time at Spoonbill, but I’ve found some real gems for my collection while sifting aimlessly through the racks.  </p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-small-businesses-\">Why is it important to support small businesses?</h2>\n<p>Small businesses are the bedrock of entrepreneurship. They make up the tapestry of a city; in New York in particular they are an essential part of what makes our creative ecosystem as vibrant as it is. On a personal note, I’m always attracted to the specific details that make an independent business tick...the smallest design flourishes and idiosyncrasies that make a space feel familiar.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-08-23 14:44 -0400","published":true,"title":"Sougwen Chung","description":"<a href=\"http://sougwen.com/\">artist</a>","fbTitle":"For New York: Sougwen Chung","socialBlurb":"Artist Sougwen Chung shares her 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.","tweetText":"Artist @sougwen shares her 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Sougwen%20Chung%20Sun's%20Organic%20Garden.jpeg"},{"name":"baron-von-fancy","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-07-09 11:05 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Baron Von Fancy\ndescription: '<a href=\"http://www.baronvonfancy.com/\">artist</a>'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Baron%20Von%20Fancy%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Baron Von Fancy'\nsocialBlurb: Baron Von Fancy shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: >-\n  .@BARONVONFANCY shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC with\n  @onbondstreet\n---\n![The Odeon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Baron%20Von%20Fancy%20The%20Odeon.jpg)\n## The Odeon\nThe Odeon is my favorite place to eat.

Luxury is being able to get your nails painted so they look like gleaming pieces of wet fruit and having them stay that way for a whole month whether you’re having high tea and crumpets or digging in your son’s butt. I’ve been getting my nails done by Sayo at Marie Nails since  it was a single-location 2-seat spot in West Hollywood. Now it’s in NYC, LA, Honolulu, and Tokyo but still as intimate and personal as ever. They specialize in Japanese cal gel (which doesn’t damage your nail bed) and nail art; Sayo has hand-painted everything from a Balenciaga rottweiler to a Yayoi Kusama squash on my tiny tips. Here’s another mini-rant…everywhere in this city, we are obsessed with the hook-up economy. Seed, post, resell, gripe. At Marie, they don’t care who you are - they see the glacial rock on your hand, they dead you if you’re 15 minutes late. There is no fancy app to book appointments, there is no Facebook Live, there are no branded candles to take home, there are no freebies. But there are always abundant hello’s and thank you's at Marie. http://marienails.com/\n\n![Lan Zhou Hand-Pulled Noodles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Miss%20Info%20Lan%20Zhou.jpg)\n## Lan Zhou Hand-Pulled Noodles \nMy husband is one of those prosperity foodies, like Pimp C “we eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning.” He loves rich foods with fancy plating and “seasonal pricing.” I’m good on all the hype, the 3-hour waits, the secret reservation handshakes, the pretty good pasta. If you really want some epic tableside plating, take a detour under the Manhattan Bridge to Lan Zhou and you might see a guy take a lump of dough and alternately stretch and slam it into long chewy noodles on the tiny table right next to you. I recommend a plate of steamed dumplings, a plate of noodles with dry minced pork and bok choy, and an orange soda. Best post-party nightcap dinner in the city. Be clear…it’s the size of a subway shoe-repair shop. The ambiance is also similar. So don’t bring your ewww-face or your dietary restrictions or your food selfie celebs.

I quickly realized it was nearly impossible to ignore the hilarious goon in the other room. After trying coffee shops and WeWorks as alternate offices, I was so lucky to find this independent coworking space just 3 blocks away from home called Friends Work Here. There are inspiring designers, bloggers,  writers, and entrepreneurs who trade wisdom and work, and many of them are fellow Brooklyn parents (which helps with preschool advice).

Literally. In a toy store in the South Side of Chicago. The stock room was where I ate dinner, the counter was where I learned math, the mall was my jungle gym. And I internalized the struggle, the hard work, and the dreams of my parents who grew that toy store into one of the most loved Chicago retail businesses, Galt Baby, still operating in downtown Chicago and Lincoln Park 30+ years later. I know how easy it is to go to a tiny store that has the most incredible hand-picked items and then go home to order it right to your front door from Amazon or Walmart. But I want everyone to know how much it means to a small business for you to spend your money with them. Maybe it’s $3.00 more and you have to carry the thing home. But your time, and their time, is priceless. The ability to touch something and hear why that store owner picked it for you is, too.\nAn algorithm will never be able to tell you why one baby stroller is better for just you and your kid. But my mom has done that for thousands of future independent business owners and customers. And she refuses to retire because she enjoys it so much.\nI think independent business means that you have the independence to react to change, re-invest in your team, listen to your audience, and see a project from start to finish.

I know how self-­fulfilling that sounds coming from someone who slings books, but like, really. The publishing system that is dying and dead is the one that created behemoths like Barnes & Noble and Borders, and guess what. Those guys are losers now. I look at the fallow corner of Sixth Avenue and 8th street where B&N used to do business and am equal parts annoyed and full of indignant joy. How marvelously we fucked ourselves as booksellers. We happy few...the decade and a half of luxury that commercial booksellers enjoyed as gatekeepers of content distribution look fucking quaint in hindsight. The fact that independent bookstores were obliterated by their intransigence is frankly tragic. If you live in New York City and can’t support a local bookstore, seriously, just catch a Pokemon off the Manhattan Bridge.\n\nBut the poster-size lithograph HOPE for books is still alive. People are going to keep assembling books in a one-seam format, and so long as Beyonce doesn’t stealth release a “visual scroll,” people will keep selling them that way. Printed Matter is a marketplace for authentic books, as well as an arts archive. They present books with consideration and share profits directly with their creators. This is SO important for the (un)dying arts. And generally speaking, books are the cheapest form of art (second maybe only to un-appraised couture hiding in thrift stores and junk shops).

I mean don’t get me wrong. I drink. Like, my BMI is a proof, not a percentage. But I like hanging with younger people, and sometimes sober people, and I like having something to do besides pretending we’re all really thirsty for soda. I love playing pool cuz it reminds me of the suburbs and I like ping pong because it makes me feel ironically Asian, and I love the fact that this place plays rad ass jazz. If they served pho and had high speed internet this place would literally be my heaven. It’s a social club with a weird barrier to entry (sometimes they’re dicks about cover), but I like when everyone can hang out late at night and not have to make it about being in a bar.\n\n![Julius](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Anne%20Ishii%20Julius.jpg)\n## Julius\nHaving said all that I said about non-drinking establishments, “the gay bar” is a social establishment and deserves its own historical preservation classification, and man, I hope this one sticks around. Julius is my favorite gay bar of all time. It’s chill, it’s low­key, it’s high energy, it’s supes cheap, and they make a phenomenal cheeseburger. I’ve come here for quiet biz drinks as well as loud ass birthday parties. And I suppose in some alternate universe where I am actually the gay man I keep thinking I will become, this is the most romantic place in the universe. It’s a neighborhood bar with a unique mandate, but universal appeal.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent business?\nSometimes I think independent businesses are a trick. A lot of them are incubating corporate chrysalises (e.g. Blue Bottle, any fashion design brand). And a lot of independent businesses that stay small are also just run by rich people who got tired of counting other people’s money. I guess what I think is more important than the idea of a business being independent is the idea that it is interdependent. It is crucial that small neighborhood businesses can be inviting to as many of its neighbors as possible, even if they only offer one pinhole-specific idea and product. IMHO, the most important element of a small, local business in New York is the element of economic sincerity. New York City has one of the highest populations of working poor who can’t afford rent, and we share walls with “Million Dollar Deal” Bravo characters. I hate thinking that with such a rich culture of social environments at their disposal, the majority of New Yorkers can only feel comfortable at a McDonald’s (no offense to the McRib) because it’s not advertised in Helvetica.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Anne%20Ishii%20Printed%20Matter.jpg\" alt=\"Printed Matter\"><h2 id=\"printed-matter\">Printed Matter</h2>\n<p>Say what anyone will - publishing is not dying or dead. I know how self-­fulfilling that sounds coming from someone who slings books, but like, really. The publishing system that is dying and dead is the one that created behemoths like Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders, and guess what. Those guys are losers now. I look at the fallow corner of Sixth Avenue and 8th street where B&amp;N used to do business and am equal parts annoyed and full of indignant joy. How marvelously we fucked ourselves as booksellers. We happy few...the decade and a half of luxury that commercial booksellers enjoyed as gatekeepers of content distribution look fucking quaint in hindsight. The fact that independent bookstores were obliterated by their intransigence is frankly tragic. If you live in New York City and can’t support a local bookstore, seriously, just catch a Pokemon off the Manhattan Bridge.</p><p>But the poster-size lithograph HOPE for books is still alive. People are going to keep assembling books in a one-seam format, and so long as Beyonce doesn’t stealth release a “visual scroll,” people will keep selling them that way. Printed Matter is a marketplace for authentic books, as well as an arts archive. They present books with consideration and share profits directly with their creators. This is SO important for the (un)dying arts. And generally speaking, books are the cheapest form of art (second maybe only to un-appraised couture hiding in thrift stores and junk shops).

It’s decidedly a women’s boutique, but being in touch with my feminine side [laughs] allows me to find some compelling stuff whenever I stop by. \n\nThe offerings range from women’s clothing, art books and ephemera, and a very well curated selection of objects - vases, small sculptures, glasses, and jewelry. Kai (Avent De Leon) does a great job of finding affordable items from up-and-coming artists and designers interspersed with a few grails from the bigger names.\n\nWhile the shop itself is one of the best in the game, the main reason I’m here on the regular is the coffee bar. Dan (Solomito) runs this part of the operation - he is an amazing guy and we’ve quickly become good friends. I enjoy getting a coffee or tea and sitting at the bar for a catch-up. And those pastries? Insane. Strongly recommend the chamomile tea with an apple turnover.\n\n![Spoonbill & Sugartown Booksellers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Hassan%20Rahim%20Spoonbill%20and%20Sugartown.jpg)\n## Spoonbill & Sugartown Booksellers\nI recently discovered Spoonbill thanks to my friends Justin Hunt Sloane and Rachel Day. Not much to say about this place except that they really know what they have. Book shops are a dime a dozen throughout Brooklyn in my opinion, but Spoonbill has the rarities. Not just expensive ones, but the meaningful ones - their pricing is actually extremely fair. You won’t find basic Barnes and Noble, mass-produced art books here. Also, anyone who has an original silkscreened Wallace Berman exhibition poster up on their walls gets bonus points in my book. \n\nMy favorite Spoonbill purchase is definitely Thinking of You, a seminal volume documenting the work of Barbara Kruger that was published by MOCA Los Angeles in the early 90s. I’ve never seen this book at any other shop; it’s filled with works and texts that I had no idea existed. My 2nd favorite purchase is what I bought today [laughs] - it’s that crazy German book documenting tubular steel chairs we looked at.\n\n![House of Small Wonder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Hassan%20Rahim%20House%20of%20Small%20Wonders.jpg)\n## House of Small Wonder\nNot much to say about Small Wonder except that Japanese business owners do everything right. This is the best place for a relaxing coffee or tea with someone special. Not only is there an enormous tree growing right through the middle of the space, the entire ceiling is a greenhouse roof, so the mood inside changes with the weather and light. Hard to say if I prefer sunny days or gloomy days at Small Wonder - they both work so well.\n\nI’d definitely recommend getting the Japanese Hamburg Steak, which is an organic ground beef patty with no bun, melted gruyere cheese on top, cooked to absolute perfection and served with a hardboiled egg. If you’re feeling experimental try the First Impression, a very weird combination of Calpico and beer that surprisingly works really well.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIndependent businesses are the core cultural influence and identifiers of any city. They can literally come to define the neighborhoods they’re based in. It’s all about the community these businesses attract and cultivate. \n\nOften times (almost inevitably), big box businesses with infinite resources will swoop in and take what independent business owners have built up over years, even decades. To the untrained eye, these stores will often have more competitive prices and maybe even be more convenient - but don’t fool yourself. Just remember the hard work and passion that goes into building something from the ground up.\n\nIt’s important to realize that by supporting the hard work of entrepreneurs, you support their dreams, as well. How can you not appreciate their passion for delivering you a piece of their imaginations, their heart, and courage?\n\nLastly, there’s a lot to be said about relationships. I always build a relationship with my favorite local spots. I believe that’s one of the best (and most defining) traits of living in New York - walking into your cafe, high fives all around. Pure positive energy. Walking into your bodega at 3AM - the sandwich guy knows your name and knows your order without you having to say anything. You can feel these people becoming an intrinsic part of your life over time.\n\nThat feeling is community. And no matter how hard these big box brands try to plant themselves in a city and siphon from it, they just can’t replicate that. Those values can only come from someone who puts their last dollar into growing a passion into a lifestyle - a reality. It’s handmade, hand-picked, considered carefully, and built with love. Products, objects, experiences - these things have stories, and it takes someone who’s incomparably passionate about them to effectively share those stories with you.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Hassan%20Rahim%20Sincerely%20Tommy.jpg\" alt=\"Sincerely, Tommy\"><h2 id=\"sincerely-tommy\">Sincerely, Tommy</h2>\n<p>Sincerely, Tommy is one of the first shops I discovered in Bed Stuy.

The way the details come together in that space is just incredible. The wood paneling, the mirrors, the old New York posters - that was all Scarr. It looks like the set of a hitman movie from the ‘70s inside!\n\nH: And of course, the pizza itself is unbelievable.

So, aside from being a real refuge for us while we were dealing with construction on Coming Soon, he was a much-needed voice of reason throughout the process. Plus, he’s actually the local pharmacy so he’s super dialed into the community. His network is much broader than the group of people that, say, we might have in common.\n\nF: Where in the world are you going to find a place that’s original as Stanley’s Pharmacy? He’ll help you sort out the right treatments for any condition you have. He’s so incredibly caring to everyone who comes by, will serve you custom-made kombucha or watermelon juice, and play some records on his awesome DJ setup. What other pharmacy has two turntables behind the counter? \n\nH: The design of the place is really respectful of the neighborhood, too. From everything being in Chinese as well as English...Stanley is a native New Yorker so the nuances in his brand really speak to how much he cares about the community.\n\n![Kiki's](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Helena%20Barquet%20and%20Fabiana%20Faria%20Kiki's.jpg)\n## Kiki’s\nF: When Kiki’s first opened, it was packed front to back with locals. Actually, this whole block was a mob scene because of how crazy the traffic was at Dimes, too. It was amazing to have these two spots that really became great spaces for the community to hang out in on one block.\n\nH: And who doesn’t love Greek food? \n\nF: Paul, one of the owners, has been really deliberate about helping the original tenants in the space move into their new spots. He kept the original awning they had up. Again, just another example of native New Yorkers looking out for each other as much as possible.\nH: And the best thing is that Kiki’s lacks any kind of pretension. The staff here makes everyone feel super welcome, the food is incredible, and for the price it’s absolutely unbeatable. It’s just such a fun time.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nH: Well because they’re authentic, they’re original, and they care.\n\nF: Think about it, right? Each of the three places we walked into today - all three owners were there. Handling shit, taking care of their customers - whether you’re a regular or a first-timer. It’s all about that support system independent businesses bring. We’re all in walking distance of each other, so when we’ll do events, Paul will come by with ice and beers for us. Then, whenever I try to pay him back, he’s always like, “no way, get away with that!” Likewise, you’ll always see people walking into our shop holding cups with orange straws because Stanley sent them over. And half of Scarr’s family - his wife, their siblings - have bought up everything in our store. \n\nH: That’s right.

Everyone there is awesome - they’re just great, solid people who are also super creative...they care in the way where they know all of their customers’ names. And probably their coffee order, as well. Each of the businesses I’ve chosen for this feature have that in common - they’re great because of how invested they are in building relationships with their supporters. Bottom line with Blue Stove is - awesome people, even better sweets. I’ve had like four birthday cakes made there including one that had a giant, dancing hot dog on it. That’s totally the best thing about independent businesses, right? You can walk in, talk to the owner about whatever your ideas are, and they’re cool to run with it. I love Blue Stove for all of those reasons.\n\n![Human@Ease](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jenny%20Regec%20Human%20at%20Ease.jpg)\n## Human@Ease\nHuman@Ease is my gym, but it’s also a lot more than that. They’re awesome because, unlike a lot of larger gyms, there’s no pretension or weird intensity involved. I could very easily walk in there at 7 am with no makeup on, looking like complete garbage, and totally feel comfortable. No pressure whatsoever. These guys might be the most significant business on my list because I just went through a three month wellness program with them. It was the first time in my life where I didn’t drink for six weeks since I was...I don’t know, eighteen? Between all the weightlifting (which I’d never done before), the nutrition advice, this infrared sauna thing they have, and body treatments - they got me on a track that’s made me feel good about myself in a completely new way. It’s also a beautiful, very personally designed space. Every nook and cranny at Human@Ease has something that speaks to the gym’s character. I try to do the same thing at Paint Box - all of the design choices we’ve made at the store are reflections of our personalities. My first conversation with the owners of Human@Ease happened because we’re both independent business owners, so our entire relationship is really built off of sharing our customers and helping each other out.\n\n![BFF Petwash](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jenny%20Regec%20BFF.jpg)\n## BFF Petwash\nBFF is the best. Again, this is another spot that’s run by normal, regular people who value the connection and support system between independent business owners. I’m a dog person so I’m there very frequently, and it’s just nice that Ania (who owns BFF) is always down to hang out and give me treats, extra shampoo, or whatever else for my dog. I don’t know how else to put it, but BFF is just a really pure place. It’s so nice to support a business like them and see how that choice directly feeds back into the community and neighborhood. My dog loves it because he really likes getting wet, he gets constant treats when he’s there, and everyone’s a total sweetheart to him.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nBecause they keep our neighborhoods grounded and sustainable. Independent businesses keep money circulating in our communities, they foster connections between people, and they help creativity flourish on a local level. You could get a lot of what you find at local businesses at a Whole Foods or Equinox, but you’re never going to build the same kind of personalized experience or relationships there. Look at what’s happened to Williamsburg - no one can keep their doors open because so many big box companies are extracting money from the community and taking it elsewhere. So supporting small businesses is really you supporting the healthy growth of a neighborhood.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jenny%20Regec%20Blue%20Stove.jpg\" alt=\"The Blue Stove\"><h2 id=\"the-blue-stove\">The Blue Stove</h2>\n<p>The Blue Stove is important to me because I love each and every person who works there as much as I love sweets.

My future wife has learned to tolerate the fact that I will play a song on repeat for an entire afternoon until I have a chance to fully wring out of it whatever I was hoping there was to wring. Or that I will cook the same cut of steak every night for two weeks straight until it tastes the way I imagined it would taste in my head. \n\nBartending for me is similar in the sense that it was always an exercise trying to achieve a combination of flavors and textures that were perfectly realized in my imagination but didn’t exist as a recipe yet.\n\nStep in to Duke’s Liquor Box.\n\nPatrick, the proprietor of Duke’s, stocks a shop of filled with bottles of booze you’ve likely never heard of. Local stuff and foreign stuff, the folks who work here are mostly seasoned bartenders, really know their spirits and are real cocktail geeks. They host a few tasting events per week with the actual distillers (they are healthily-portioned tastings if that matters...) which is a great way for local folks to get educated. A few years back I had an idea for a cocktail I wanted to call the “Come, Come Mister Bond---” I knew that it was to taste of “Alpine” without knowing what that actually was. A trip to Duke’s and I was set with a Pine liqueur I never knew existed. Patrick also spends a lot of time out in front of the store with his son (and the shop’s namesake) Duke, and as such knows just about everyone and everything that’s happening in the community.\n\n![Tar Pit Cafe](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Matthew%20A%20Ricke%20Tar%20Pit.jpg)\n## Tar Pit Cafe\nSummer of 2011 I was working at a motorcycle repair show right off McCarren park in Williamsburg and my boss was Kerry Sano-- Moto rider, trained NASCAR mechanic and owner of the recently opened Tar Pit Cafe. In addition to the beautiful Kyoto-style Cold Brew rig she built, Kerry also managed to turn 200 square feet of abandoned storefront in a lonely corner of Greenpoint into a warm and inviting spot to read the paper, get some espresso and pastry, and do some motorcycle watching.  Kerry was a big part of me becoming an entrepreneur and she and I plan to start a coffee roasting company at some point in the future. We don’t have any talent or experience but we have picked out a name….\n\n![Archestratus Books + Foods](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Matthew%20A%20Ricke%20Archestratus.jpg)\n## Archestratus Books + Foods\nI met Paige, the owner of Archestratus, at a community board hearing in which our request to put a small cocktail bar in our restaurant’s garden space was unceremoniously rejected and Archestratus was approved to serve Beer & Wine as part of their Cafe service. Part bakery, part restaurant, part bookstore-- Archestratus is an incredible shop committed to cooking, its practice and its history. In addition to the usual suspects, Archestratus carries some of the quirkiest and unexpected cook books you’ll ever come across. Prior to hospitality I spent years working in publishing and bookselling and have watched bookstore after bookstore disappear. It’s refreshing to know that there are still book-people out there and that some of them are entrepreneurs like Paige. We stop in multiple times per week for her incredible pastries and sometimes a glass of wine or two.  Archestratus is also the perfect place to go when you need a gift, some inspiration or maybe just a good recipe. \n\n## Why is it important to support local businesses?\nAt home, we have a beautifully stupid and loving 6 year old dog named Tessa. Yes, we could buy her food on Amazon and save a few bucks and spare me lugging a 50 lb bag of kibble down the street. But, we like that the folks at our local pet store know Tessa by name, that they know what kind of treats she likes, and we like that she looks forward to visiting the shop as much as they look forward to seeing her. We like knowing that if we run out of food on Sunday morning they are right down the street. But they won’t continue to be here unless we commit to being their patrons.\n\nIt’s painful to watch local businesses get priced out by inflated rents and online shopping and even more painful when folks act surprised to see Mom and Pop’s go out of business. Local and independent businesses are owned and operated by real people not corporations and if we want them to stick around we need to stay involved! \n\nWhether as a gathering spot for strangers to bond over a mutual interest (like cooking or motorcycles or cocktails) or as a surrogate for our tiny NYC apartments, Local businesses offer much more than just products-- they provide a place in the community to engage your neighbors that non-local businesses have no authentic interest in providing. \n\nAt the bottom of our menu are the words “Owned and Operated by Residents of Greenpoint,” a fact that was snarkily commented on by the NY Times earlier this year in yet another half-baked think piece about how New York City maybe lost its soul. Owned and Operated by Residents of Greenpoint means we’ve been here for a hot minute. We didn’t read about how Greenpoint was the next Williamsburg in a newspaper and decide to stake our claim.  We established businesses here because we have lived here for years and because we are invested in our community. We have more than 40 employees and while some of them take the train in from Manhattan, from Queens and even a few from the Bronx, the vast majority of our team walks to work. It means we live in and are at the mercy of 11222. No longer mere residents, we are proud shopkeepers in our neighborhood. We know our neighbors and they know us. If you really want to boil it down, supporting neighborhood businesses means taking measurable pride in your neighborhood itself and i don’t think anything speaks to the soul of New York City more than that.\n\n_Photographs by David Atisha Paulson_\n\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Matthew%20A%20Ricke%20Main.jpg\" alt=\"Duke’s Liquor Box\"><h2 id=\"duke-s-liquor-box\">Duke’s Liquor Box</h2>\n<p>I have a sort of bingey personality--- I get fixated on a song or a project or a flavor and I tend to just live there until my attention is redirected.

A few years back I had an idea for a cocktail I wanted to call the “Come, Come Mister Bond---” I knew that it was to taste of “Alpine” without knowing what that actually was. A trip to Duke’s and I was set with a Pine liqueur I never knew existed. Patrick also spends a lot of time out in front of the store with his son (and the shop’s namesake) Duke, and as such knows just about everyone and everything that’s happening in the community.</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Matthew%20A%20Ricke%20Tar%20Pit.jpg\" alt=\"Tar Pit Cafe\"><h2 id=\"tar-pit-cafe\">Tar Pit Cafe</h2>\n<p>Summer of 2011 I was working at a motorcycle repair show right off McCarren park in Williamsburg and my boss was Kerry Sano-- Moto rider, trained NASCAR mechanic and owner of the recently opened Tar Pit Cafe. In addition to the beautiful Kyoto-style Cold Brew rig she built, Kerry also managed to turn 200 square feet of abandoned storefront in a lonely corner of Greenpoint into a warm and inviting spot to read the paper, get some espresso and pastry, and do some motorcycle watching.  Kerry was a big part of me becoming an entrepreneur and she and I plan to start a coffee roasting company at some point in the future. We don’t have any talent or experience but we have picked out a name….</p><span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Matthew%20A%20Ricke%20Archestratus.jpg\" alt=\"Archestratus Books + Foods\"><h2 id=\"archestratus-books-foods\">Archestratus Books + Foods</h2>\n<p>I met Paige, the owner of Archestratus, at a community board hearing in which our request to put a small cocktail bar in our restaurant’s garden space was unceremoniously rejected and Archestratus was approved to serve Beer &amp; Wine as part of their Cafe service. Part bakery, part restaurant, part bookstore-- Archestratus is an incredible shop committed to cooking, its practice and its history. In addition to the usual suspects, Archestratus carries some of the quirkiest and unexpected cook books you’ll ever come across. Prior to hospitality I spent years working in publishing and bookselling and have watched bookstore after bookstore disappear. It’s refreshing to know that there are still book-people out there and that some of them are entrepreneurs like Paige. We stop in multiple times per week for her incredible pastries and sometimes a glass of wine or two.  Archestratus is also the perfect place to go when you need a gift, some inspiration or maybe just a good recipe. </p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-local-businesses-\">Why is it important to support local businesses?</h2>\n<p>At home, we have a beautifully stupid and loving 6 year old dog named Tessa. Yes, we could buy her food on Amazon and save a few bucks and spare me lugging a 50 lb bag of kibble down the street. But, we like that the folks at our local pet store know Tessa by name, that they know what kind of treats she likes, and we like that she looks forward to visiting the shop as much as they look forward to seeing her. We like knowing that if we run out of food on Sunday morning they are right down the street. But they won’t continue to be here unless we commit to being their patrons.</p><p>It’s painful to watch local businesses get priced out by inflated rents and online shopping and even more painful when folks act surprised to see Mom and Pop’s go out of business. Local and independent businesses are owned and operated by real people not corporations and if we want them to stick around we need to stay involved! </p><p>Whether as a gathering spot for strangers to bond over a mutual interest (like cooking or motorcycles or cocktails) or as a surrogate for our tiny NYC apartments, Local businesses offer much more than just products-- they provide a place in the community to engage your neighbors that non-local businesses have no authentic interest in providing. </p><p>At the bottom of our menu are the words “Owned and Operated by Residents of Greenpoint,” a fact that was snarkily commented on by the NY Times earlier this year in yet another half-baked think piece about how New York City maybe lost its soul. Owned and Operated by Residents of Greenpoint means we’ve been here for a hot minute. We didn’t read about how Greenpoint was the next Williamsburg in a newspaper and decide to stake our claim.  We established businesses here because we have lived here for years and because we are invested in our community. We have more than 40 employees and while some of them take the train in from Manhattan, from Queens and even a few from the Bronx, the vast majority of our team walks to work. It means we live in and are at the mercy of 11222. No longer mere residents, we are proud shopkeepers in our neighborhood. We know our neighbors and they know us. If you really want to boil it down, supporting neighborhood businesses means taking measurable pride in your neighborhood itself and i don’t think anything speaks to the soul of New York City more than that.</p><p><em>Photographs by David Atisha Paulson</em></p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-07-27 11:37 -0400","published":true,"title":"Matthew Ricke","description":"owner - <a href=\"http://www.theexley.com/\">The Exley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.esmebk.com/\">Esme</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Matthew%20A%20Ricke%20Main.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Matthew A Ricke","socialBlurb":"Matthew Ricke, owner of The Exley bar and Esme restaurants, shares his 3 favorite businesses in NYC.

I’m happy to meet people wherever, but you gotta know that the food is good. So...Villa is a hike for a lot of people in the city, but 9 times out of 10, when I’ve had people come out for the meeting here? The deal gets done a little easier. Whatever we’re meeting about tends to go the right way. And then the same people who give me shit about coming out this far end up asking me to link up at Villa next time they see me. \n\nVilla is dope to me because, one - food-wise, everything is good. Everything I’ve ever had at Villa is good. Two - if you go to Villa two times, by the third time they know who you are. Three - there’s a super neighborhood feel there. You know what I’m saying? It’s not like you’re going to a restaurant; you’re getting restaurant food in a restaurant setting, but it’s almost like you went to your homie’s place for a meal. For instance - just now, we struck up a conversation with two random dudes about who’s the best pitcher, right? Those guys weren’t like, oh we’re not gonna talk to these dudes cuz I’ve never seen them before, they go, “oh they’re at the spot? Not with that jersey!” - and like that, we’re in the middle of a heated debate about who’s the best pitcher. It feels like you know everyone when you’re at Villa. When you can find yourself in a place like that, you always end up wanting to go back. Especially because the food is good. \n\nI used to eat the entrees, but one day, the guy I first met who works there was like, “yo, try this” - it was the pizza - and then I was like, aw damn. Now I’m fucked. Now I can’t order anything else. So every time I’m in there now I order the brick oven grandma pie. Round, thin crust. I don’t do thick crusts. There’s another Villa in Howard Beach and Park Slope, but this is the best one. Grandma pies from Villa. \n\n![Turntable Lab](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/DJ%20Clark%20Kent%20Turntable%20Lab.jpg)\n## Turntable Lab\nWhen I think of record stores, I first think of Rock and Soul, but something about Turntable Lab ends up being a little better for me. They really cater to the DJ in a certain way that no one else does. Rock and Soul sells records; so does Turntable Lab. It’s just that the Lab is so much more committed to being straight to the DJ. Practically everyone who works at that spot is a DJ, which is completely different from going to a spot run by entrepreneurs who happen to be selling audio equipment. If the latter will be like, “oh, there’s 15 kinds of headshells, so we’re going to sell all 15,” the Lab guys will tailor it for DJs and say, “no, we’re just gonna sell the three headshells that DJs should have.” Also (and again, because they’re all DJs), the selection is more relevant to people who are DJing today. Right now. They have the newest gear available and ready to try out - you walk in, it’s all there in front of you. You don’t have to sort through it or have a crazy conversation with someone about finding this and that. They also stay in touch with you in a way that’s somehow not annoying - their emails are actually dope! What business do you know that sends dope emails that make you want to come back to the store? \n\nThe most impressive thing about Turntable Lab, though, is that they treat everyone who walks in the door the same way. Doesn’t matter if it’s me or someone just starting to learn how to DJ, they let relationships build up organically. That’s super dope to see a crew like that treat all of their customers with respect - like they’re DJs. \n\n![Tom, Dick & Harry](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/DJ%20Clark%20Kent%20Tom%20DIck%20and%20Harry.jpg)\n## Tom, Dick & Harry\nTom, Dick & Harry is the hood superstar store. When we were coming up, you went to Tom, Dick & Harry because Tony had all the sneakers before anyone else. And he would let you buy them early. This was before there were release dates and rules about “oh, you can’t have these before Foot Locker gets them” or whatever. Shit landed at the store and that was it. You always went to Tom, Dick & Harry - almost like it was a stop on the way to any destination - because at any given moment, there could be a shirt, a hat, a jacket, or sneakers that you didn’t even know you needed. It would always be there first.\n\nBecause it was so close to Marcy - if you were out there with Jay or Jaz or anybody - Tom, Dick & Harry was consistently the one place we’d go to if we were in the area. No matter what else we were doing that day. “Let’s go see what they got.” And Tony had all the Airs. Every color of the Air Force 1 that came out, they got it. Jordans was cool, too, but in the hood, Airs was bigger than anything. Don’t get it confused - we all loved our specialty basketball shoes, Pippens, all of that - but at that time, it was Airs. Nothing else mattered  And they had all the fresh gear, so whenever you were at TomDees, it was like a one-stop shop. You could buy everything, walk away, and be fresh. \n\n![Spicy Action](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/DJ%20Clark%20Kent%20Spicy%20Action.jpg)\n## Bonus: Spicy Action\nSpicy Action is a completely different monster. It came in a little later than TomDees. That’s right across the street, though. It didn’t look anywhere near as pretty (it still doesn’t look as pretty) but their whole thing was having crazy shit that no one else had. Early. It’s a come in, buy your sneakers, get out kinda spot. But they had shit that even TomDees didn’t - so if you were looking for something and it wasn’t at TomDees - you’d stop in at Spicy and chances were that you’d find it there. \n\nThere are four sneaker spots on this block alone, but you always went to TomDees first. Then, later on, when this sneaker thing started going off for kids in the street, Spicy had them covered. This dude, I swear to God, he’ll have ten pair size 13 of anything I’m looking for. Even today when we walk in. Guaranteed. I don’t know how he does it. It’s weird. ...He’s good. I’m not going to say nothing else about him besides the fact that he’s good. He’s really, really good.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nYour hood can’t last if you don’t support the independent businesses in it. It can’t survive. Independent businesses are the cornerstone of the neighborhoods they sit in - they’re the DNA of their communities. When you walk into Tom, Dick & Harry, you gotta think - we’re in the middle of the hood. So that means they better be friends with everyone in the area - otherwise, they’ll disappear. They go extinct. When you go to the hood and you see race relations that are completely retarded, but you walk in the store and it’s like everyone’s cool because they all know the owner and vice versa, you’re like, “okay, everything’s not so bad. Maybe there is some hope out here.” \n\nIt’s a testament to the owners that we still love going back to these places. Understand me - at my age, I shouldn’t even be thinking about going back to these spots because I don’t live anywhere near them anymore. But everyone at Spicy, TomDees, they know I’ll be back. And they’re happy to see me when I am. Independent business is the fabric, man. It’s an essential part of a neighborhood’s legacy...so if I’m not coming back, I cut off a part of my history. I cut off a part of who I am.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/DJ%20Clark%20Kent%20La%20Villa.jpg\" alt=\"La Villa Pizza (Avenue U location)\"><h2 id=\"la-villa-pizza-avenue-u-location-\">La Villa Pizza (Avenue U location)</h2>\n<p>I’m a firm believer in having meetings where the food is good.

It's always essentially the same stuff with slight tweaks depending on where you are - novelty pins, pressed pennies, bumper stickers, printed ephemera, etc. I always seek it out whenever we get to our destination and it's more or less become my way to explore a new city. Dripper World has a wide and well-curated collection of these kinds of items, as well as records, tapes, and merch for/by a lot of local NYC punk bands. My friend Betty first told me about the store when I noticed this really amazing earring she was wearing one night. She showed me their Instagram (@dripperworld) and I had to check out the store in person.

The summer it opened, SIGNAL became our first rehearsal space. It was also where we played our first show. And, more recently, they hosted our record release party. I think that a lot of other artists, musicians, and performers in the community share a similar relationship with Signal. It's like home base and their doors are always open. It is first and foremost an excellent and forward-thinking art gallery, run by our friends Kyle and Alex, though in practice it functions as much more than that. In its giant, primary white box space, you’re as likely to find a noise show going down as you might a book fair, a fundraiser, a party, a party that is also a fundraiser, or a painting exhibition. And, if nothing happens to be scheduled on any particular night, you can usually find Kyle and Alex hosting a campfire in the backyard with cold beers for anyone who happens to pass through.\n\n![Sincerely, Tommy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Wet%20Sincerely%20Tommy.jpg)\n## Sincerely, Tommy\nK: I was introduced to Sincerely, Tommy and owner Kai Avent-DeLeon by our awesome stylist Jess Willis last year when we were looking for clothes for a video shoot. Since then, I've religiously followed what's going on over there and am always in awe of how cool and tasteful Kai is. I find her vision for Sincerely, Tommy inspiring. Now, whenever I need something to wear for a tour, a shoot, or just for fun, it's become my go-to place in the city. I love the clothes, the coffee, the art, the photos, and the events that they put on.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nJ: To me, it's so nice and comforting to know and support the people who are serving your community. This is especially true in a city like New York where things can (and often do) feel so impersonal and ephemeral. I think it's important for everyone to have some sort of relationship with the people who provide the goods and services that keep this city running...and in the case of Dripper World, keep it vibrant. : )\n\nM: Small businesses are woven into the fabric of our city in a way that corporations and chains simply can't (they probably have little to no interest in this, anyways). Whether it's the little pizza shop on your corner or it's the neighborhood bar, these are the institutions that bind communities together. It also goes without saying that they're usually just better than big box alternatives.\n\nK: Kai grew up 4 blocks away from Sincerely, Tommy - her connection to Bed Stuy is reflected in the space in so many ways. It's important to support businesses that are owned and run by those who are in touch with and care about the needs of the people who live in those communities rather than huge companies that don't care or even profit from the destruction of the neighborhoods they go into.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Wet%20Dripper%20World.jpg\" alt=\"Dripper World\"><h2 id=\"dripper-world\">Dripper World</h2>\n<p>J: One of the best parts of touring for me is getting to check out all the strange junk and trinkets you come across at rest stops and the random souvenir stores around the US and in other countries.

Whether it&#39;s the little pizza shop on your corner or it&#39;s the neighborhood bar, these are the institutions that bind communities together. It also goes without saying that they&#39;re usually just better than big box alternatives.</p><p>K: Kai grew up 4 blocks away from Sincerely, Tommy - her connection to Bed Stuy is reflected in the space in so many ways. It&#39;s important to support businesses that are owned and run by those who are in touch with and care about the needs of the people who live in those communities rather than huge companies that don&#39;t care or even profit from the destruction of the neighborhoods they go into.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-07-26 09:23 -0400","published":true,"title":"Wet","description":"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV7ufuW0VFY\">band</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Wet%20Main%20Portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Wet","socialBlurb":"Wet shares three of their favorite local businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@wet shares three of their favorite local businesses in NYC"},{"name":"dominic-and-chris-leong","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-10-14 09:48 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Dominic and Chris Leong\ndescription: 'co-founders - <a href=\"http://www.leong-leong.com/\">Leong Leong</a>'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Leong%20Leong%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Dominic and Chris Leong'\nsocialBlurb: 'Leong Leong co-founders share their 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.

In that time, they’ve built up a legacy by providing a gathering place for New York’s architects, designers, artists, and just creatives in general. Its an epicenter for creative conversations and production in the city - a lot of projects that otherwise wouldn’t have happened got off the ground at Storefront.\n\nC: For me, Storefront is one of those unique spaces in the city that is so unassuming - it’s one of those hiding-in-plain-sight spots that everyone peers into when they walk by - but so much of what gets discussed inside ends up bleeding out onto the street. You’d be surprised by how many architectural projects in the city literally happen because of conversations facilitated by Storefront. \n\nWe’d always held the organization in high regard - even before we were participants. If you’re in our industry you’re probably familiar with Vito Acconci and Steven Holl’s iconic design for Storefront even if you’ve never been before. \n\nD: Our studio is pretty close by, so we really gravitated towards Storefront and everything they stand for. A lot of architectural institutions and forums in America kind of come with this ivory tower mentality attached to them. Storefront is really antithetical to that - their walls literally open out onto the sidewalk. Openness and dialogue is fundamentally built into their model.\n\nC: Lastly, because of their reputation, Storefront is able to help a lot of independent (and often smaller) practices jump into larger scale conversations that they wouldn’t be able to easily participate in otherwise. \n\n![Elizabeth Street Garden](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Leong%20Leong%20Elizabeth%20Street%20Garden.jpg)\n## Elizabeth Street Garden\nD: Elizabeth Street Garden - run by the group Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden - is one of the last green spaces of its kind in lower Manhattan. It’s contributed so much to the atmosphere of the neighborhood; businesses like Lovely Day and Gimme! Coffee have obviously benefited from it being there. It creates this moment of repose and sanctuary amidst the constant movement you experience in Soho.\n\nC: Right - the garden is a really timeless space in a city that’s constantly shifting. Part of New York’s beauty is that relentless growth; you have to embrace it if you live here...but it’s also nice to be able to offset or juxtapose that with something like Elizabeth Street Garden. The whole space is steeped with the history and ambiance of the neighborhood. I think it’s really essential that we maintain places like this for the health of the communities that surround them.\n\n![Asian Americans for Equality](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Leong%20Leong%20Asian%20Americans%20for%20Equality.jpg)\n## Asian Americans for Equality\nC: Asian Americans for Equality is an organization that we’ve been working with for the past year and a half on a project out in Flushing. They’re interesting because they started out as an advocacy group in 1974 supporting Asian Americans in Chinatown. When the Confucius Plaza tower was being built, they got Asian American workers involved in that project when there initially were none. \n\nSince then, they’ve grown to become this platform that provides financial and legal services, affordable housing, and so on in lower Manhattan. What’s really interesting about their mission is that it centers so heavily around supporting small and emerging businesses. The project that we’re doing in Flushing with them is both an incubator for supporting entrepreneurs and giving them a venue to interact with the public and community in a more meaningful way. So it’s kind of a physical articulation of their directive all in one place. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nD: In a city that’s as dense as New York is, everything and everyone are connected to one another, whether you like it or not. Independent businesses have traditionally always been hubs for communities - spaces where people gather even if they’re not actively interacting with one another. So we wanted to choose spots in our feature that we think act as positive, constructive vectors for the neighborhoods, cultures, and industries they affect. \n\nIndependent businesses are uniquely positioned to help cultivate the ecosystems they’re part of - unlike many large scale, corporate businesses, these places tend to be closer to the ground. The owners often have very personal, individual interactions with their customers. So you’re then able to build this support system for people, especially minority groups and immigrant populations, who might not be able to reliably access that elsewhere. Long story short, they’re really important for diversity in a city.\n\nC: In terms of development, there’s a formula that works as basically liability management. Developers will always try to place a bank or chain pharmacy on a block that’s about to be gentrified. This is something we see all the time - it yields a very homogenous kind of urbanism that doesn’t necessarily speak to the needs of people who live in these neighborhoods. \n\nAs such, the importance of small businesses is that, like Dominic said, they’re extremely keyed into the particular needs and priorities of the community around them. Even more noteworthy is that they are then able to adapt to how these communities evolve, as well. So you get this dynamic, growing relationship as opposed to one that’s very monolithic and static. I think it’s important to highlight that.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Leong%20Leong%20Storefront%20for%20Art%20and%20Architecture.jpg\" alt=\"Storefront for Art and Architecture\"><h2 id=\"storefront-for-art-and-architecture\">Storefront for Art and Architecture</h2>\n<p>D: Storefront has been on this corner in Nolita for over thirty years.

Of course, if it’s the best butcher in New York City, one could easily make the argument that it’s one of the best butchers in the entire world. The crew here maintains a very discreet and small shop, but they’re a big deal - they’re the celebrity draw on the block for sure. I’d like to think that the Future Perfect is, but if I’m being honest, people are coming into our shop all the time holding beef. \n\nOf course, you then have the element of surprise with Bohemian in the back. There’s nothing I love more than a secret spot with a number and door that’s challenging to find. Both Bohemian and Premium Beef are quintessentially Japanese in how they keep the operation small but laser-focused on craft. The way both spots are set up really reminds me of shopping in Tokyo over anything else in New York. Everything from the presentation of goods (whether it’s salt, meat, t-shirts, or sauces), to the ridiculous chandelier, to the cow sculpture - it’s all so considered and exactly how it should be. Everyone who works there is unbelievably knowledgeable and helpful - having a conversation with them before you buy something will yield the best home-cooked meal you’ll make in your life.

You have to be deliberate in this industry because it’s so easy for customers to get confused if you aren’t. So, if Future Perfect has one very particular point of view, John Derian is almost its diametric inverse - it’s the other end of the spectrum. I absolutely love it there - I’ll buy gifts all the time from John Derian and spend a bunch of time browsing the chockablock selection they’ve got going on. It’s the most glamorous yard sale of all time, and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. If we’re very spare, they’re as spectacularly busy and mixed up as it can get. That juxtaposition is precisely why I love John Derian so much - it’s a great place for me to go and reset my perspectives and thinking. You’ll always find an unexpected gift for the person who has everything here. \n\n![The Future Perfect Secret Spot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/David%20Alhadeff%20Future%20Perfect%20Secret%20Spot.jpg)\n## The Future Perfect Secret Spot\nWe haven’t even officially launched or named the Future Perfect Secret Spot yet! This showroom is a very exclusive and private space for our clients who are interested in something we have to offer but can’t find it in the store. It’s a response to that happening quite a bit, especially as of late. We don’t make the venue available to everyone, but if you’re in here, you’re getting the full survey of what we have on-hand. The inspiration behind this space stemmed a bit from, again, shopping in Japan, where, to find a store or restaurant, you’d have to go through the lobby of an office building, climb down a few flights of stairs, go out the back, into the parking lot, and past a nondescript hallway. That’s such a typical thing out in Asia, but non-ground-floor opportunities are so underexplored here in New York.\n\nOpening the Secret Spot has allowed us to shift our shop at 55 Great Jones to emphasize stories and context around pieces, which is really important in design. If you can use story to ultimately evoke an emotional response around a design object, that’s as special as it gets. This, of course, means we show less things at 55 Great Jones, so (to bring things full circle) the showroom allows us to display everything we don’t have on the floor in a more relaxed manner. The client response to the Secret Spot has been great so far. We’re really excited about it. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nWhere do you even begin? Independent businesses fuel the fire that is our economy. You go to places like Amazon for all the predictable, routine things you need - and that’s great. But to find all of the stuff that you didn’t know you wanted or needed, everything you want to be pleasantly surprised by - it makes way more sense to spend your dollars at an independent business. These are places where creativity and individual points of view shine - they’re where personality really comes through. Most importantly, you can see your dollar directly supporting the livelihoods, perspectives, and ambitions of the people who independently own businesses. As someone who founded and owns an independent business, that was a really powerful realization for me.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/David%20Alhadeff%20Japan%20Premium%20Beef.jpg\" alt=\"Japan Premium Beef (and Bohemian)\"><h2 id=\"japan-premium-beef-and-bohemian-\">Japan Premium Beef (and Bohemian)</h2>\n<p>Sitting next door to us is Japan Premium Beef, which, for my money, is the best butcher in the city.

If you want chemicals that are, well...strictly for the trade only...let’s just say you can smell that building from a few blocks away.\n\nK: It smells like your nose is dissolving.\n\nC: It’s pretty incredible. Abbot is a great paint and finish store. You can go in there, tell them what you’re trying to paint, and they’ll know exactly what you need to get the job done.\n\nK: You might come to them with a problem like, “oh, I need it to be this color and glossy, but it’s in a restaurant so it has to dry overnight,” or “it needs to go on steel but be UV and weather resistant.”\n\nC: Whatever weird requests you have. They have, like, crazy German spraypaints that are only for lacquer repair...you name it. \n\nK: It’s really funny because, even if you’re at the smaller location down where our new studio is, they’ll call the one old guy in Greenpoint who has all the answers to everything. \n\nC: Super sweet people and always a pleasure to deal with. They close at like, 5, but if you have a late order that you absolutely need to grab, they’ll leave the paint in the store next door for you to pick up. Who does that?\n\n## Lendy’s\nC: I think all of the track lighting and electrical supplies on construction sites in lower Manhattan are sourced from Lendy’s. \n\nK: It’s this huge, beautiful, classic Soho space on Grand. The border between Little Italy and Chinatown. They’ve spec’d things for me that are completely specific and out of the ordinary.\n\nC: They have all kinds of hardware but they specialize in all electric components. Everything and anything.\n\nK: If you need a clip for a lamp that hasn’t been sold in 20 years or a stand that doesn’t exist anymore, they’ll troubleshoot the whole thing with you and figure out what the best solution is.\n\nC: That’s the beautiful thing about all these stores, right? The people at all of them are genuinely interested in helping you solve your problems. \n\nK: My favorite thing is how you still have to pull a number and wait, like at old delis. Until recently, they were using carbon paper credit card readers. You know, the ones that make that ch-chunk sound?\n\nC: You’re never waiting, per se, when you’re in there, though. It’s amazing to watch these guys behind the counter go back and forth with each other.\n\n## Victor Machinery\nK: This is a store that sells machine tool parts...which is a market that is pretty much nonexistent today. You’re only ever going there when you’re in a jam. I was working for Tom Sachs back in the day, and he’d send us into the store to buy anything they weren’t interested in moving. That was almost always incredibly heavy steel stuff.\n\nC: They’re across the street from Roberta’s now, and it basically says “Don’t Come In.” You go down these stairs and there are usually a few guys who look like they never left the 70s or early 80s. Eventually, one of them might walk up to you and say something. \n\nK: You point at things in their catalog, give them the numbers of the items you want, and they’ll rummage around in the back until they find what you’re looking for. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nK: I think we chose all of the businesses we talked about because none of them are just stores to us. They’re places we go to gain knowledge and speak with actual people. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love instant gratification and shopping on Amazon. When you know exactly what you want or you’re looking for something basic, that’s exactly where you go. However, these stores are where you discover all the things you didn’t know you needed.\n\nC: You go to them with problems, right? You can’t do that with something like Amazon. You tell this guy who knows everything about this one specific field and get free, time-tested advice along with your purchase. \n\nK: At first glance, the owners of these places might seem surly or mean. But if you’re humble and you open up to them with the clear intent to learn something, they’re the most helpful and kindhearted people in the world.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"abbot-paint\">Abbot Paint</h2>\n<p>C: We used to go to Abbot Paint’s main location in Greenpoint back when our studio was in the area.

Everything and anything.</p><p>K: If you need a clip for a lamp that hasn’t been sold in 20 years or a stand that doesn’t exist anymore, they’ll troubleshoot the whole thing with you and figure out what the best solution is.</p><p>C: That’s the beautiful thing about all these stores, right? The people at all of them are genuinely interested in helping you solve your problems. </p><p>K: My favorite thing is how you still have to pull a number and wait, like at old delis. Until recently, they were using carbon paper credit card readers. You know, the ones that make that ch-chunk sound?</p><p>C: You’re never waiting, per se, when you’re in there, though. It’s amazing to watch these guys behind the counter go back and forth with each other.</p><h2 id=\"victor-machinery\">Victor Machinery</h2>\n<p>K: This is a store that sells machine tool parts...which is a market that is pretty much nonexistent today. You’re only ever going there when you’re in a jam. I was working for Tom Sachs back in the day, and he’d send us into the store to buy anything they weren’t interested in moving. That was almost always incredibly heavy steel stuff.</p><p>C: They’re across the street from Roberta’s now, and it basically says “Don’t Come In.” You go down these stairs and there are usually a few guys who look like they never left the 70s or early 80s. Eventually, one of them might walk up to you and say something. </p><p>K: You point at things in their catalog, give them the numbers of the items you want, and they’ll rummage around in the back until they find what you’re looking for. </p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>K: I think we chose all of the businesses we talked about because none of them are just stores to us. They’re places we go to gain knowledge and speak with actual people. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love instant gratification and shopping on Amazon. When you know exactly what you want or you’re looking for something basic, that’s exactly where you go. However, these stores are where you discover all the things you didn’t know you needed.</p><p>C: You go to them with problems, right? You can’t do that with something like Amazon. You tell this guy who knows everything about this one specific field and get free, time-tested advice along with your purchase. </p><p>K: At first glance, the owners of these places might seem surly or mean. But if you’re humble and you open up to them with the clear intent to learn something, they’re the most helpful and kindhearted people in the world.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-07-09 10:36 -0400","published":true,"title":"Chen and Kai","description":"designers and founders - <a href=\"http://chen-williams.com/\">Chen Chen and Kai Williams</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/img_0208_1024.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Chen and Kai","socialBlurb":"Chen Chen and Kai Williams founders share three of their favorite local businesses in NYC.","tweetText":"Chen and Kai founders share three of their favorite local businesses in NYC with @onbondstreet"},{"name":"kenzo-minami","markdown":"---\ntitle: Kenzo Minami\ndescription: '<a href=\"http://www.kenzominami.com/\">artist & designer</a>'\ncategory: favorites\ndate: 'Wed Jun 08 2016 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/KenzoMinamiMainPortrait.jpg'\npublished: true\ntweetText: >-\n  .@KenzoMinami shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC with\n  @onbondstreet \nsocialBlurb: Kenzo Minami shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC.\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Kenzo Minami '\n---\n\n![Dimes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/KenzoMinamiDimes.jpg)\n\n## Dimes\n\nI’ve known the Dimes girls for a long time - we met before the restaurant existed, actually, and they were working elsewhere.

A friend of mine told me about Sincerely, Tommy in Bed Stuy when I first moved to NY almost 2 years ago. The space itself is beautiful and the selection is so well curated - there’s such a great mix of new, local designers and independent brands that the owner, Kai, has come across throughout her travels all over the world.

Lately I’ve been big on their monk bowl, which has black rice, seasonal vegetables, tahini, and sesame seeds. Also, I’m from LA, and the vibe of Stonefruit really reminds me of places that I used to frequent in Echo Park or Eagle Rock - I find that really comforting.

There’s no seating, which I like - no lighting, which I also like - it’s open 24 hours a day and no one ever smiles at you. Most importantly, the food is legitimately the best. It’s never anything less than amazing - no one I’ve taken to Peppa’s has left disappointed. The thing is, I didn’t even know about Peppa’s until I was in college because I went to high school on the Upper East Side with a bunch of white and Asian kids. So, for a while, I was disconnected from the kids who grew up in the neighborhood I was actually from. It was kind of like this double life. I went to St. John’s for college, though, so at that point I found myself back in this predominantly West Indian, first generation group of kids who’d grown up where I did. Through them, I started being able to catch up on all this stuff I’d missed in high school. After parties, we’d get in the car (no one ever took cabs, everybody drove) and my boys would drive us home. On the way, we’d stop at Peppa’s, get a five dollar plate, crush that, go to bed. From that point on, anyone who visits me in New York and wants good West Indian food? We go straight to Peppa’s.\n\n## Allan’s Bakery\n\n![Allan's Bakery](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JudnickMayardAllans_w1280.jpg)\n\nAllan’s is a really famous Haitian bakery on Nostrand that’s been around since I was a kid. It’s on a strip of Nostrand that’s full of West Indian businesses. Allan’s is where we got patties for literally every single milestone event that I attended since I was a child. There’s a competitor on the street that some people use, but no one in my circle fucks with them. It’s funny because, like Peppa’s, I never stepped into Allan’s until I was an adult. But in this case it’s because, as a kid, I’d always have to wait in the car. Nowadays, they cover the whole West Indian spectrum, but when I was little it was always known as a very Haitian spot.\n\n## Fine Line Tattoos\n\n![Fine Line Tattoos](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JudnickMayardFineLineTattoo_w1280.jpg)\n\nFine Line is owned by a guy named Mehai Bakaty, who inherited the shop when his father passed away two years ago. I’ve been going to Fine Line since 2008. I have ten tattoos; Mehai’s done six of them. I met Mehai because my friend got this really beautiful Le Petit Prince from him. Up until then, all my tattoos had been pretty random - I decided I really wanted an artist who I could call and discuss ideas with going forward. So my friend introduced me to Mehai and...the first time I met him, he convinced me to change the location and size of my design. If you know me, anyone who can make me change my mind about anything is someone I trust for sure. Now we’re at the point where I’ll just text him and be like, “hey! I saw this thing in a book,” and he’ll work through the concept with me. Another great thing about Fine Line is that it’s right by where East Village Radio was. I’d go by on Friday nights when the Fader was doing the Let Out and get a tattoo during the middle of the show. Later on, I found out that Fine Line was the same spot Amy Winehouse was getting tattooed at when she did her Fader interview. Pretty crazy.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nMy grandfather was an independent business owner- he owned and operated a printing press in Jackson Heights. I’d spend all my weekends there. I just remember being super proud that my grandfather owned his business and looking up to the rapport he had with each of his customers. I’m one of those kids who grew up obsessed with how characters on TV and in movies could call up their Chinese spot and the guy would immediately know their regular orders. So my grandfather having that same connection with his customers was super inspiring to me. That’s the beautiful thing about independent businesses - they know your family, they know your friends...the familiarity there really elevates those businesses beyond final transactions, you know? It becomes something way more essential to the community.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JudnickMayardPeppas_w1280.jpg\" alt=\"Peppa&#39;s\"><h2 id=\"peppa-s\">Peppa’s</h2>\n<p>Peppa’s is close to me because it’s pretty much my idea of what a perfect West Indian restaurant is.

Nowadays, they cover the whole West Indian spectrum, but when I was little it was always known as a very Haitian spot.</p><h2 id=\"fine-line-tattoos\">Fine Line Tattoos</h2>\n<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JudnickMayardFineLineTattoo_w1280.jpg\" alt=\"Fine Line Tattoos\"><p>Fine Line is owned by a guy named Mehai Bakaty, who inherited the shop when his father passed away two years ago. I’ve been going to Fine Line since 2008. I have ten tattoos; Mehai’s done six of them. I met Mehai because my friend got this really beautiful Le Petit Prince from him. Up until then, all my tattoos had been pretty random - I decided I really wanted an artist who I could call and discuss ideas with going forward. So my friend introduced me to Mehai and...the first time I met him, he convinced me to change the location and size of my design. If you know me, anyone who can make me change my mind about anything is someone I trust for sure. Now we’re at the point where I’ll just text him and be like, “hey! I saw this thing in a book,” and he’ll work through the concept with me. Another great thing about Fine Line is that it’s right by where East Village Radio was. I’d go by on Friday nights when the Fader was doing the Let Out and get a tattoo during the middle of the show. Later on, I found out that Fine Line was the same spot Amy Winehouse was getting tattooed at when she did her Fader interview. Pretty crazy.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>My grandfather was an independent business owner- he owned and operated a printing press in Jackson Heights. I’d spend all my weekends there. I just remember being super proud that my grandfather owned his business and looking up to the rapport he had with each of his customers. I’m one of those kids who grew up obsessed with how characters on TV and in movies could call up their Chinese spot and the guy would immediately know their regular orders. So my grandfather having that same connection with his customers was super inspiring to me. That’s the beautiful thing about independent businesses - they know your family, they know your friends...the familiarity there really elevates those businesses beyond final transactions, you know? It becomes something way more essential to the community.</p>","date":"2016-06-16 13:11 -0400","published":true,"title":"Judnick Mayard","description":"Event Producer, Tour Manager ","category":"favorites","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/JudnickMayardMainPortrait.jpg","tweetText":".@Judnikki shares three of her favorite local businesses in NYC with @onbondstreet","socialBlurb":"Judnick Mayard, event producer and tour manager, shares three of her favorite local businesses in NYC.","fbTitle":"For New York: Judnick Mayard"},{"name":"rocky-xu","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-07-26 09:20 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: 'Rocky Xu '\ndescription: '<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rockyxu/\">classified</a>'\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Rocky%20Xu%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Rocky Xu'\nsocialBlurb: Rocky Xu shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: .@igetbuckets shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC\n---\n![Parm](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Rocky%20Xu%20Parm.jpg)\n## Parm\nCarbone is my favorite restaurant in the city, but if I don’t have the time to sit down there, I know I can always head over to Parm, get a seat, and have a solid chicken parm or hero. That’s why I fuck with Parm - it’s such an easy, simple spot for lunch or dinner; I guess you could call it Carbone Lite. There’s no scene, it’s not hyped, and there’s no pretension. The food is consistently on point, whether you’re getting a platter or a sandwich. Oh, the Italian fries are banging. I’d also say that Parm also has one of the better playlists I’ve heard at any restaurant in the city. Lastly, the location of the OG spot is unbeatable - even if it’s smaller and a little tucked away, I like that you can get a quick meal and bounce to anywhere else in Soho within minutes. \n\n![The Color House](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Rocky%20Xu%20Color%20House.jpg)\n## The Color House\nI’d been developing film at other spots around the city for a while, but I started going to Color House because my buddy Darryl put me onto it. When I first started going by, I could tell by the people dropping rolls off that this shop was pretty official. The guys at Color House take time to make sure that your results are as good as they can be. It’s all in the details - aside from the image quality being super tight, they put all of your photos in a nice envelope and give you a CD with the digital files loaded on it. Obviously, most people don’t have optical drives anymore, so they have on-site computers that you can use to transfer files to USB drives. It’s just that level of personal attention that separates them from everyone else. Again, the last thing is location. You can’t beat Color House’s situation on Lafayette. They’re open pretty late, too, so if I’m in the area, I’ll grab a bite to eat, drop my film off, and head home.  \n\n![The Good Company](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Rocky%20Xu%20The%20Good%20Company.jpg)\n## The Good Company\nTo be honest, yesterday was the first time I’d actually been in the actual store, but I’d been following The Good Company and people who sell at their shop for a minute. Everyone knows this, but we’re living in a moment where people are so hung up on trends and what everyone else is doing. It’s all too reactive. I feel like The Good Company guys carved out a niche for themselves, move at their own pace, and are just humble kids who are doing it for creativity’s sake. It’s an attitude that I haven’t felt at a store like that in some time. They’ve got art up by Devin Troy Strother, they sell zines that their friends produce, their in-house brand is cool...all of that is made even better by the fact that none of it seemed to be done with the intent of ending up on social media. We all know how vital social is to a small business’ success, but I like The Good Company because they don’t seem to prioritize that. Instead, it’s just about good people making cool shit first. I just copped a tee that Peter Sutherland made that has this print of a crushed La Croix can on it.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIt’s pretty crazy that you can start a business with an idea and an iPhone...and, if that idea is good, you can build a following - a community - around it. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s important that there’s a balance between big and small businesses for the economy to function properly, but the best ideas are grown organically, and that’s why independent businesses are so essential. They can explore and cultivate those ideas without the restrictions that a large corporation might have to deal with. Look at something like Sweetgreen - what started as a pretty out-there idea at one spot in Georgetown has effectively made it so that everyone now wants to be more conscious about what and how they eat. So, again, someone with the autonomy to commit to an idea has to think of it, people have to gravitate towards (and support) it, and then, if it grows successfully, it can challenge entire industries to reconsider their practices.

CW has that magic. Who thinks of something like that, right? “I’m going to open a store in the LES in 2016 and just sell pencils and erasers sourced from all over the world.” Coming across this hidden gem gave me great hope; it made me realize that I am indeed able to chase the craziest dreams that I have at this moment. With everything being so technology-driven today, it’s essential that we continue to embrace writing, drawing, and all of these extremely visceral skillsets that the world seems to largely be ok with neglecting.\n\nTo that end, the people who work at CW are really inspiring to me as well - Alex, who was behind the desk when we walked in today - she’s a writer. And she writes all of her first drafts by hand! Like I said earlier, that truly gives me hope - it makes me believe that we can and will retain these wonderful skills that I grew up learning in school, whether it’s calligraphy, crafting letters, or even something as simple as scribbling notes down on a pad instead of on your phone.\n\n![Dashwood Books](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/jonathan_mannion_dashwood_books_1024.jpg)\n## Dashwood Books\nI’ve been visiting Dashwood regularly for years - as the owner, David, said when we walked in, “don’t I remember you coming in that one time and just doing a ton of damage?” He was referring to this one day a few years ago where I just decided to buy a ton of books for my close friends. This spot has such a beautiful selection of information - they find the leading voices from all corners of culture and history that people need to be exposed to. On the other end of the spectrum, Dashwood is also a trove of incredibly obscure works - so anytime you walk in you can lose yourself in this fantastic range of perspective-expanding media. In turn, that experience hopefully acts as a launch pad for the generation of your own ideas. I’m not talking about copying what someone else is doing - rather, you should find yourself inspired to pursue projects that might otherwise seem unrealistic. Say you want to do something like photograph a one-legged soccer player in Bangladesh or something like that - there’s a book at Dashwood that will undoubtedly help you realize that the scope of your ambition is achievable.\n\nI’d also like to mention that everyone who works here is so welcoming; they really give you the opportunity to digest everything at your own pace. Books make great gifts because they represent the exchange of ideas - every time I stop by Dashwood I try to find something for a friend or family member.\n\n![Perla Cafe](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jonathan%20Mannion%20Perla%20Cafe.jpg)\n## Perla Cafe\nLastly, we’re sitting at one of my favorite restaurants in the city, Perla Cafe. There’s a gentleman named Gabe Stulman who’s been a dear friend of mine for four years. He allowed me to be a part owner of Fedora, another one of his establishments that’s diagonally across the street from here. As part of this arrangement, he let me curate the restaurant - anything on the wall is either a photo that I took, a photo that inspired me, or a work from an artist who I admire (from Charming Baker to Neil Leifer’s Muhammad Ali piece to Ben Watts and so on). What’s beautiful about this dynamic is that we always make sure the art is changing and responsive to what’s going on.\n\nWhen Gabe opened Perla, he extended me the same offer that he did with Fedora. As such, my contribution as part owner of this restaurant has been to, again, curate the look and feel of the space. We’re sitting next to one of my prints of the mighty Yasiin Bey, aka Mos Def. I was doing a project with artists where I wanted to see what their contributions to my portraits of them would be if I gave them free reign and every drawing utensil imaginable. Mos, naturally, wrote so beautifully about the origin of his name. This is one of ten prints of that piece in the world. In choosing the works that hang at Perla and Fedora, I really wanted people to be able to experience art of this quality in a context that feels a little more physical, tangible, and a bit closer to home.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nPeople who strike out to run their own businesses share one thing - an incomparable passion for what they do and the product they deliver. A burger that I have at Perla is probably going to be the best one I’ve had in months because they care that much more. Independent business owners hone their passion and energy by diligently studying craft and taking the time to perfect their wares. They bring together all of these elements and present the resultant package to the audience as a complete, coherent thought. In doing this, they give something back to the community and manage to elevate culture. That’s why I’ll always support people who take that leap of faith - they tend to grow wings on the way down.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Jonathan%20Mannion%20CW%20Pencil%20Enterprise.jpg\" alt=\"CW Pencil Enterprise\"><h2 id=\"cw-pencil-enterprise\">CW Pencil Enterprise</h2>\n<p>Being an old school cat, it surprises me whenever I come across something in the city that has a little bit of magic in it.

This is a journey I’ve been on since college when I won a gift certificate via an eating contest to one of those mayo-all-over-the-Philadelphia-roll spots. Needless to say, it was a real revelation when I finally graduated to legitimate omakase establishments. I’ve tried almost every spot in town at this point, and, while places like Masa are great, I find myself in the Lower East Side at Sushi Ko more than anywhere else. You can’t beat the quality and price combination that they’re working with. The chef (and owner) John Daley is extremely focused on perfecting his craft while simultaneously being this very relaxed, friendly guy. His willingness to impart knowledge about different kinds of fish makes the experience at Ko even more accessible. Super inspiring. Every time I’m there, I make sure to remind John that he’s completely ruined any other sushi for me.    \n\n## Five Star Salon\nI’ve been getting my hair cut by the same people at this salon since I was twelve. When I was younger, my family lived in Connecticut. Once a month, we’d drive into to the city to buy groceries and eat real Chinese food and all that. Obviously, those trips would find us in Flushing pretty frequently. Five Star was where we’d stop by so I could get my hair cut. I don’t know what it is about our head shapes and hair, exactly, but it’s impossible for me to get the same kind of cut I want at Supercuts or whatever, man. That’s just asking for disaster. So yeah, back in those days, I’d wait a month to get my hair cut at this one spot in Queens and I’d be good for a couple of weeks. Until about a year ago, it was six bucks for a cut, too. We’re at eight bucks now - huge jump. My guy always jokes about how I should bring back my orange, spiky hair that I had in high school. \n\nAnother cool thing to watch at Five Star is how the staff I grew up with have assumed managerial roles. Half their business is Latino folks, so most of the staff at the salon speak Spanish as well as Cantonese and Mandarin. I think one of them actually lived in South America for a while - it’s a trip to see all these Northern Chinese immigrants laughing and chatting with their Latino customers. That’s Flushing for you.\n\n## Circle Nightclub\nDamn, has anyone done this one yet? I gotta give a shoutout to Circle - it’d be wrong of me not to. Despite the negative press about it as of late, it’s still a place where I’ve had...who knows how many memorable nights with my friends. The nostalgia is real - I did a lot of growing up at Circle. It’s kind of an experience that every Asian kid in the city goes through, right? You line up in these ridiculous queues, try to get into VIP, pay a premium for that, then try to get your hands on a bottle of something for the table - just an absurd amount of hoops to buy into a vibe. But looking back on all of that stuff is how you start parsing out what’s really important in your life, you know? Not only do you realize how solid your real friendships have become, but you’re also able to start thinking about priorities and where you’re headed. Are you going to be about that life forever? Is there a balance you want to strike? Are you over it entirely? It’s kind of deep in a weird way! Shoutout to Circle. For real.\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nI think that independent businesses have a lot more room to be creative with their decisions. It’s not that large corporations don’t want to innovate, it’s just that they’re too unwieldy - you can’t turn that big of a ship quickly enough to match how quickly the audience moves now. That’s why you see big businesses looking at small businesses all the time for inspiration - we’ve had so many restaurant chains and franchises come by Xi’an over the past few years, trying to figure out what’s under the hood. So by supporting independents, you’re actually supporting people who push creativity in business forward every day of their lives. That’s worth a lot.\n","html":"<h2 id=\"sushi-ko\">Sushi Ko</h2>\n<p>Like so many New Yorkers, I’m on this neverending mission to figure out what the best sushi restaurant in the city is.

Not only do you realize how solid your real friendships have become, but you’re also able to start thinking about priorities and where you’re headed. Are you going to be about that life forever? Is there a balance you want to strike? Are you over it entirely? It’s kind of deep in a weird way! Shoutout to Circle. For real.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-support-independent-businesses-\">Why is it important to support independent businesses?</h2>\n<p>I think that independent businesses have a lot more room to be creative with their decisions. It’s not that large corporations don’t want to innovate, it’s just that they’re too unwieldy - you can’t turn that big of a ship quickly enough to match how quickly the audience moves now. That’s why you see big businesses looking at small businesses all the time for inspiration - we’ve had so many restaurant chains and franchises come by Xi’an over the past few years, trying to figure out what’s under the hood. So by supporting independents, you’re actually supporting people who push creativity in business forward every day of their lives. That’s worth a lot.</p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-07-09 18:55 -0400","published":true,"title":"Jason Wang","description":"founder - <a href=\"http://xianfoods.com/\">Xi’an Famous Foods</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/jason_wang_main_portrait.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Jason Wang","socialBlurb":"Jason Wang of Xi’an Famous Foods shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC.","tweetText":"Jason Wang of @xianfoods shares three of his favorite local businesses in NYC with @onbondstreet"},{"name":"deirdre-quinn","markdown":"---\ndate: '2016-06-30 18:41 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Deirdre Quinn\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Deirdre%20Quinn.jpg'\ndescription: >-\n  co-founder - <a href=\"http://www.lafayette148ny.com/\">Lafayette 148 New\n  York</a>\ncategory: favorites\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Deirdre Quinn'\nsocialBlurb: >-\n  Deirdre Quinn of Lafayette 148 New York shares three of her favorite local\n  businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: >-\n  .@lafayette148ny co-founder shares three of her favorite businesses in NYC\n  with @onbondstreet\n---\n## Lafayette 148 New York\nFor our customization and speed.

One of the revelatory things about moving to Park Slope was that I could buy, say, shampoo, a fan, and a mirror - whatever I needed at that moment - all in one place down the street. That was exciting to me because it wasn’t easy to do that in most neighborhoods I’d lived in before (and also because I don’t actually order anything from Amazon). Finding a great, family-owned hardware store with awesome employees that was stocked with anything I need...that made me feel like a giant safety net had opened up under me.\n\n![Bagel Hole](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Naomi%20Zeichner%20Bagel%20Hole.jpg)\n\n## Bagel Hole\n\nMost weekends, my boyfriend and I try to spend at least one morning in the neighborhood. Both of us have pretty active weeknights, so it’s nice to catch up and slow down a little bit on a Saturday or Sunday. We’ll usually walk from 1st street down to 12th, grab a coffee from Grumpy, and then hit up Bagel Hole. I’m generally not a carb person, but Bagel Hole is worth it! I love that their bagels are manageably sized, they’re not fussy, and the whole operation moves really fast. A lot of new spots will have these wild, elaborate sandwiches and you’ll wait for 45 minutes in a line, but you’ll never queue up for more than 2 minutes at Bagel Hole. If you’re blinking, hungover, and trying to figure out what you want, they’ll get rid of you like that. I feel like the orange juice in their cooler is always extra cold, too. So, yeah - just a crucial weekend spot for me.\n\n![D'vine Taste](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Naomi%20Zeichner%20D'Vine%20Taste%20Main.jpg)\n\n## D’vine Taste\n\nD’vine Taste isn’t somewhere I’d go to shop for groceries, but I’ll always stop in to buy something if I’m headed to a dinner at someone else’s house. Maybe if I’ve been a bitch and I’m trying to apologize to someone, I’ll go and pick up cookies or pastries for them beforehand. I love that they have hamentashen during Purim, too; I used to make hamentashen with my mom when I was a kid, so it’s nice that there’s a place near my house where I can buy some to celebrate the holiday. D’vine has such a warm atmosphere and it feels like I’m buying a luxury item of sorts whenever I’m there; they don’t necessarily have the cheapest pastries, but I always know that my money is being well spent.\n\n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\n\nI’m kind of a homebody, so it’s really nice to have places in my neighborhood that make the block feel like, well, home. Increasingly, however, I’m seeing that a lot of local businesses people assume will always be around are starting to turn over. I’m not sure if it’s big chains that are pushing most of these establishments out or if they’re simply being replaced by more fashionable, updated local businesses. Either way, if you find a place that’s making something that you appreciate, it’s important to show love so they can sustain themselves. Otherwise, they might disappear forever.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Naomi%20Zeichner%20Tarzian%20Hardware.jpg\" alt=\"Tarzian Hardware\"><h2 id=\"tarzian-hardware\">Tarzian Hardware</h2>\n<p>I’ve lived in many neighborhoods throughout New York - Bushwick before it was completely gentrified, Bed Stuy...the list goes on.

This place is really special to me because it’s one of the first spots that embraced me in the neighborhood. The owner, Pat, has this incredibly warm energy around him - I love the way he runs the cafe and how he connects with the neighborhood. If you look across the street, you can see that we’re right by a high school. All of the guys who work here are so helpful to faculty members and encouraging to the students - it’s a great space for everyone to discuss what’s stressing them out and talk about issues in a way they might not be able to at school. \n\nEverything they serve at Love is amazing and affordable - you can get a full meal for five or six bucks. I’ve been coming here for about seven years, now. It’s been awesome to watch them expand and grow while staying true to the neighborhood around them. There’s such a good vibe here. If anyone I know is around East Harlem I always make sure to send them to Love first.\n\n![Fierce Nail Spa](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Laura%20Stylez%20Fierce%20Nail%20Salon.jpg)\n## Fierce Nail Spa\nOK, so the real thing about Fierce Nail Spa is the owner Guadalupe’s story. Guadalupe is from Mexico - she immigrated here and started working for a big chain called Dashing Diva, where she wasn’t treated, let’s say, with the most respect. Not to shit on Dashing Diva, but that’s how it went down. So when she started looking for work at other nail shops, she noticed that there was a void in Harlem. I can definitely attest to that; me and most other girls in the neighborhood would always go get our nails done downtown because there wasn’t a spot that had good products and service near us. \n\nSo, Guadalupe decides to go her own route and opens up Fierce in the neighborhood...and, man, I just really saw her go through the ringer. People would come in and say crazy discriminatory things to her in front of her kid, complain about the prices, everything. But she held her ground and really invested a lot into the quality of the product and experience - every cent that I spend at Fierce is well worth it. Her daughter, Michelle, is also an incredible artist; I’ll bring in insane photos from magazines or Instagram and she’ll recreate them perfectly on my nails. I push these guys as frequently as I can on social - Michelle’s gone on to do nails for Serena Williams, Ashanti, and a bunch of other people. That makes me really happy.\n\nThe shop we’re at right now is actually Fierce’s second location, and I’m sure Guadalupe will open another one soon because she’s been so successful. Every time I’m in here it’s like I’m talking with my aunt. Her perseverance and story are so important to me, man. \n\n![Row House](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Laura%20Stylez%20The%20Row%20House.jpg)\n## Row House\nRow House is kind of new to the neighborhood - I’ve been coming here for about a year. It’s really nice because it’s so versatile - you can come here for a quick meeting, brunch, dinner, drinks after a long day, whatever - everything will be super on point and everyone on the team is great. It’s just the spot; this is quickly becoming the Cheers of our neighborhood. Shoutout to the oysters, too - the oysters are awesome. I guess the big cosign for Row House is that you’ll always see people from downtown here, as well. So, yeah, Row House is probably where you’ll find me if you’re in this part of Harlem. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nIt’s important to me to support independent businesses because they always make me think of family. I’m always motivated by the stories, courage, and struggles of people who take a chance. I know so many people - whether they’re family members, friends, or anyone else - who never take a shot at opening their dream business. That’s just asking for a life filled with regrets, you know? So I really respect people who do capitalize on opportunity...people like Guadalupe, who barely spoke English when she moved here, but dove into teaching herself the language and business fundamentals so she could get Fierce off the ground. \n\nAdditionally, independent businesses are so important to building community. There’s nothing better than walking into a store or a salon or a restaurant that you feel like you’re a part of. That, I’d say, is the most gratifying part about supporting independent businesses for me.\n\n_Photographs by David Brandon Geeting_\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Laura%20Stylez%20Love%20Cafe.jpg\" alt=\"The Love Cafe\"><h2 id=\"the-love-cafe\">The Love Cafe</h2>\n<p>We’re at The Love Cafe up in East Harlem!

There’s nothing better than walking into a store or a salon or a restaurant that you feel like you’re a part of. That, I’d say, is the most gratifying part about supporting independent businesses for me.</p><p><em>Photographs by David Brandon Geeting</em></p>","category":"favorites","date":"2016-08-16 15:22 -0400","published":true,"title":"Laura Stylez","description":"media personality - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurastylez\">HOT 97 and Sirius XM</a>","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Laura%20Stylez%20Main%20Portrait%20.jpg","fbTitle":"For New York: Laura Stylez ","socialBlurb":"HOT 97's Laura Stylez shares her 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC.","tweetText":".@laurastylez of @HOT97 shares her 3 favorite independent businesses in NYC"},{"name":"mike-hernandez","markdown":"---\ncategory: favorites\ndate: '2016-07-18 09:51 -0400'\npublished: true\ntitle: Mike Hernandez\ndescription: >-\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIuY3DkjFwI\">pro skateboarder</a>,\n  career firefighter - <a\n  href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/FDNY-Ladder-118-Engine-205/305339242875468\">\n  FDNY Ladder Company 118</a>\nimage: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Mike%20Hernandez%20Main%20Portrait.jpg'\nfbTitle: 'For New York: Mike Hernandez'\nsocialBlurb: >-\n  Pro skateboarder and firefighter, Mike Hernandez, shares three of his favorite\n  local businesses in NYC.\ntweetText: >-\n  Pro skateboarder Mike Hernandez shares three of his favorite local businesses\n  in NYC with @onbondstreet\n---\n![Smooch](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Mike%20Hernandez%20Smooch.jpg)\n## Smooch\nSmooch is right up the block from my house, so I like it for obvious reasons. The owner is this hilarious character from Australia. When wifey and I started dating back in ‘04 we started frequenting Smooch a lot - at that time, this block was considered off the beaten path, so there were way fewer people who’d be in there. It kind of stayed slow like that for two or three years, to the point where we were worried that they’d have to shut down. As Fort Greene has gradually come to embody the apex of gentrification in Brooklyn, Smooch has gotten more and more packed. I’m not disenchanted about people finding out about the spot, though - it’s great that Smooch can draw a crowd. There’s a strong community around it - everyone who’s a regular knows each other. The fact that it’s still kicking after all this time is a testament to them doing things the right way. Plus, I don’t use sweeteners besides maple syrup, so they let me keep a private stash of it on deck at the facilities.\n\n![Ina](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Mike%20Hernandez%20Ina.jpg)\n## Ina\nIna started out as a women’s high fashion consignment store way back in the day. I actually met the manager at the time, Khadejia, because I used to work for Russell Karablin (aka SSUR) in ‘99, ‘00 when they were dating. Once Ina expanded next door and started doing men’s consignment as well, I’d pop my head in more and more. They quickly became the place I’d go if I was looking for a formal piece of clothing - a suit jacket or something like that. Ina opened not long after Supreme did...I wanna go out on a limb and say they’ve been around since the mid-late ‘90s. So, again, the longevity is a real testament to how much of an asset they’ve been for Soho and the community. I’ve seen a lot of businesses (both big and small) on Prince come and go since the skate days - Ina could be the longest-standing one on the block. While it’s on the low and kind of hidden in plain sight, there’s jewels at Ina - if you want to buy something special, hit them up.  \n\n![Lovely Day](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Mike%20Hernandez%20Lovely%20Day.jpg)\n## Lovely Day\nFor whatever reason, the staff - both men and women alike - are all good looking here. More importantly, the food is crazy. The owner of Lovely Day, Kazusa, was dating a guy I knew who worked for Corpus Denim. I was working at Nom de Guerre at the time, right before I went to the Academy, and we used to carry Corpus at the store. So that’s how I met Kazusa and started coming to Lovely Day. While a lot of the things I just mentioned have either changed up or disappeared, I’ve been a patron at Lovely Day ever since. Also, a Japanese woman making Thai food with Mexican cooks - that’s some true New York shit right there. \n\n## Why is it important to support independent businesses?\nSimply put, supporting small businesses keep local, non-corporate, family-owned infrastructures stable. That support allows these systems to remain independent and continue to serve the communities they’re in. This isn’t just true of New York, this is something that is universally applicable to any town or city in the country. Your support of small businesses keep them healthy, which in turn allows communities to remain healthy, as well.\n","html":"<span class='clearfix'></span><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Mike%20Hernandez%20Smooch.jpg\" alt=\"Smooch\"><h2 id=\"smooch\">Smooch</h2>\n<p>Smooch is right up the block from my house, so I like it for obvious reasons.
