## Tarzian Hardware

I’ve lived in many neighborhoods throughout New York - Bushwick before it was completely gentrified, Bed Stuy...the list goes on. One of the revelatory things about moving to Park Slope was that I could buy, say, shampoo, a fan, and a mirror - whatever I needed at that moment - all in one place down the street. That was exciting to me because it wasn’t easy to do that in most neighborhoods I’d lived in before (and also because I don’t actually order anything from Amazon). Finding a great, family-owned hardware store with awesome employees that was stocked with anything I need...that made me feel like a giant safety net had opened up under me.

## Bagel Hole

Most weekends, my boyfriend and I try to spend at least one morning in the neighborhood. Both of us have pretty active weeknights, so it’s nice to catch up and slow down a little bit on a Saturday or Sunday. We’ll usually walk from 1st street down to 12th, grab a coffee from Grumpy, and then hit up Bagel Hole. I’m generally not a carb person, but Bagel Hole is worth it! I love that their bagels are manageably sized, they’re not fussy, and the whole operation moves really fast. A lot of new spots will have these wild, elaborate sandwiches and you’ll wait for 45 minutes in a line, but you’ll never queue up for more than 2 minutes at Bagel Hole. If you’re blinking, hungover, and trying to figure out what you want, they’ll get rid of you like that. I feel like the orange juice in their cooler is always extra cold, too. So, yeah - just a crucial weekend spot for me.

## D’vine Taste   

D’vine Taste isn’t somewhere I’d go to shop for groceries, but I’ll always stop in to buy something if I’m headed to a dinner at someone else’s house. Maybe if I’ve been a bitch and I’m trying to apologize to someone, I’ll go and pick up cookies or pastries for them beforehand. I love that they have hamentashen during Purim, too; I used to make hamentashen with my mom when I was a kid, so it’s nice that there’s a place near my house where I can buy some to celebrate the holiday. D’vine has such a warm atmosphere and it feels like I’m buying a luxury item of sorts whenever I’m there; they don’t necessarily have the cheapest pastries, but I always know that my money is being well spent.  


## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I’m kind of a homebody, so it’s really nice to have places in my neighborhood that make the block feel like, well, home. Increasingly, however, I’m seeing that a lot of local businesses people assume will always be around are starting to turn over. I’m not sure if it’s big chains that are pushing most of these establishments out or if they’re simply being replaced by more fashionable, updated local businesses. Either way, if you find a place that’s making something that you appreciate, it’s important to show love so they can sustain themselves. Otherwise, they might disappear forever.
