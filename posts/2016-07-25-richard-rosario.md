## La Parada
La Parada is the take-out portion of a larger, more famous restaurant called, Travesias. I come here all the time to grab breakfast and lunch. The owner Brian Martinez is beyond cool. He’s the type of guy you can sit and talk to for hours on end because he’s so charismatic and always has something to say. Sometimes my food even gets cold because I’m so excited to catch up with Brian and I forget to eat!

## Capital Shield Agency ("The Bronx Tax Man")
John Cerini, aka "The Bronx Tax Man," is like a mentor to me. He’s also my accountant. Not only does he give me endless advice on my day-to-day business, but he keeps me updated on industry trends and other relevant info. He’s so involved with the community, I bet he’ll run for office one day and win. He’s just a magnet of positive vibes. He knows everyone. Really great guy and a great business.

## Pink Shisha
Pink Shisha is a nail and beauty salon on East Tremont. The owner Millie is a marketing guru -- we’re always talking about various events and brainstorming new ways that we can market ourselves. The amount of referrals that Millie has sent me over the years is staggering, I’m really grateful.

## Why is it important to support independent business?
Supporting independent businesses is fundamental to everyone’s success. Anyone and everyone who is, or has been an entrepreneur, understands that you start a small business to make a difference in your life and improve the community around you. Even though every business offers something different, there’s a DNA to independent businesses that we all share. I support independent businesses because I support people’s passions. I support their trials and tribulations. I support their triumphs. I support independent businesses because I care about my neighborhood. I support independent business because I am them and they are me.
