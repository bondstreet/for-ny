## Chikarashi
A couple years ago, before I opened Football Cafe, I remember this girl telling me that I should look into starting a poke spot. At the time, I didn’t really see it and wondered if she could give me an example of a restaurant that was in that lane. Fast forward a few years and I found myself recalling that conversation when a buddy of mine told me that we should check out Chikarashi. We went together and I was really blown away with how well the concept is executed here. Everything about it feels great and, of course, it’s in this really interesting location right on the north side of Chinatown. There aren’t too many restaurants of that caliber in Chikarashi’s direct vicinity - it’s cool to see these guys bring that level of cooking to Chinatown or Nolita or whatever this area technically is. 

It’s super convenient and accessible, but you have to go during off-hours because you can’t even step inside during lunch. I really like the whole idea and execution behind Chikarashi.

## Magic
Magic is at the top of like a five floor walkup at 175 Canal, not too far from Chikarashi, actually. It’s run by my guy, Gogy. I found out about this whole operation when I followed my friend here while he was getting a cut (at the time, I had a different barber). They do a lot of stuff in this space - Magic is as much an art gallery where a lot of up and coming artists have shows as it is a barbershop. Gogy will also show his own work from time to time; he’s a really talented photographer and multimedia-style artist. It’s a really interesting experience - hard to find, but a really beautiful loft space that’s quiet with great light. Hidden right in the middle of Canal Street. That feels really rare and old school New York to me. 

Gogy has a deep rolodex of customers - he’s super plugged into the culture. For instance, when Supreme will do editorials or lookbooks, they call him to do all the grooming. He’s cutting hair for a lot of people who everyone knows, but I won’t blow up their spot here.

## Miscelanea NY
Anna Sheffield told her boyfriend about Miscelanea, who then told a bunch of us. She kept insisting that we had to visit this spot that no one had heard of or seen before, like, it’s on East 4th between Bowery and 2nd and none of us could even visualize it. So I made a point of finding it and immediately fell in love with the whole concept. Miscelanea is this contemporary, Mexican style grocery full of bric a bracs, prepackaged stuff from Mexico, magazines you can only get in Mexico, small bites, their own products, drinks like horchatas...the full spread. The vibe is really good in here - everyone is super friendly and the concept is so clear. This kind of store, to me, is what New York needs more of - not CVS’s. You can get actual groceries and a meal here, but it’s also such a good representation of the owners’ culture. I’ll always support people who run businesses like these.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Small businesses are crucial to the economy of any city. Look what happens when we don’t support independent businesses in New York - the entire city starts turning into a giant, outdoor shopping mall. You lose the spirit that neighborhoods are built on. Everything gets turned into a corporate version of what it was, whether it’s a Starbucks taking over a local cafe, or a Duane Reade moving in where there used to be like a mom and pop drug store. That’s really sad to me. Do you want to live in a city that’s all branches of big banks and pharmacies? I can’t imagine that’s true for anyone, even people who work at big banks and pharmacies. If I wanted to live by a mall I’d move to Dallas or wherever. There’s something incomparable about being on a first name basis with the owner of a business you support - they know your habits, what you like and need...how can any big retailer beat that? 

Look, I understand how capitalism works and that it’s not really something that we can stop, but if I can slow it down a bit by supporting independent businesses I’m happy to do that for as long as I can.
