## The Butcher’s Daughter
It’s healthy, local and is consistently amazing. Every meal I have ever had there is incredible, they also have amazing take out options as well.

It is one of my favorite places to workout in New York. The space is beautiful and the founder Vanessa has created fun, challenging and energizing class programing. (cardio sculpt with Sam is my favorite!)

## Catbird
I don’t even think anything needs to be said. This place is HEAVEN - everything is made by local artists and handcrafted. It’s so beautiful what they have done with such a small space. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I love supporting local businesses - as an owner of one myself I love getting to know the community and interacting with patrons/clients. I love going into my favorite places and knowing who my server is or who I am getting my jewelry from. There are also incredible stories behind all of these local places, why they started, what inspired them to do what they do - it creates an energy in the community that is contagious.
