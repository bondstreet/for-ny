## Ludlow Coffee Supply and Ludlow Barber Supply

As the owner of Ludlow Coffee Supply and Ludlow Barber Supply, this is essentially my office. This is where I’m at every day. It’s a dope little meeting point for people in the city on a block that’s disappearing. The hope and goal is that these businesses help preserve a little bit of our culture.

When I open up a business, I don’t really think about the money first. To me, what’s most important is creating a dope environment that gives back to the community and a brand that people know is authentic. I want to help build community over anything else.

## Mikey’s Ice Cream

I’m always down to support people who didn’t receive a formal business education but are taking their shot and making things happen. Mikey exemplifies that and he’s 100% for the community. I know Mikey from around - he’s born and raised here like me.

## Stadium Goods

The same goes for John at Stadium Goods. I’ve known John a long time - all the way back to when we were writing on walls. To see him step up and put so much into Stadium Goods is pretty dope - it’s really inspiring. We actually launched our collaborative Sweetchick sneaker with Fila at Stadium Goods; it was a classic case of two local guys supporting each other.

## Why is it important to support independent business?

The New York spirit and attitude I grew up surrounded by is fading a little...and it’s harder than ever to succeed here. So, as a native New Yorker, it’s really crucial for me that we support local businesses; they’re essential to keeping our culture alive. Locals offering the community authentic experiences and choices is something I’ll always be down for.
