## Miss Lily’s

Let’s talk about Miss Lily’s. I’m the biggest fan of their beef patties...if they ever stopped making beef patties I don’t think I could support them as a business anymore. Just joking! Those patties are seriously amazing, though - I don’t know how they make them but the Miss Lily’s patty is like an elevated version of the ones I’ve eaten my whole life...I almost compare it to a boeuf bourguignon. Seriously. The jerk chicken is great, too. I’ve been coming to Miss Lily’s since I moved to New York...it was one of the first places I ate at when I got to the city. Aside from the food being excellent, I think they do a great job of contributing and adding something that’s very needed to the neighborhoods around them.

## Mulberry Iconic Magazines

So, I’m in the magazine and publication distribution business. Mulberry Iconic is one of the places I deal to (they stock publications I rep like Sneeze, Buffalo Zine, and Happy Reader) - I really enjoy working with the owners, Hamal and Tamal. These guys have been rocking with me since I was running my business out of a basement in Montreal...I called them randomly telling them about what I had on hand and they gave me a shot. They’re great clients who operate a few of the corner stores around the city that will have, you know, those massive and sort of random selections of niche, limited periodicals. I support those guys because they support me a lot - which is as simple a relationship as it gets. It’s a no-brainer, really. Anytime I’m in there, I’ll buy magazines just for myself or for a friend. Easy.

## Dashwood Books

Dashwood isn’t a client of mine (as they don’t sell magazines), but I’m a big fan of their selection and have stopped by regularly since I moved to New York. They basically sell extremely hard-to-find books - all of your rare, out-of-print manuscripts, and generally whatever else no one seems to be able to get their hands on. Lots of signed books, as well. As I mentioned earlier, I’m in the magazine distribution business, but before anything professional I’m a fan of this culture. Rare books and publications fascinate me. So anyone or any business that represents that culture is something I’ll support til the end. I couldn’t tell you what precisely distinguishes Dashwood’s collection from other stores’ (like Mast or something like that), but as you look through what they have it’s easy to tell that their perspective is totally unique.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Independent businesses are the country’s primary economic engine. We drive the whole machine; we make it move forward. Besides that, though, independent businesses are exceptionally clear reflections of the dreams, goals, and vision of the people behind them. It’s really cool to be able to experience something that directly demonstrates how much work goes into making it tick every day. As an entrepreneur myself, being supportive of other independent businesses (in whatever ways I can) only helps me learn what I can do better with my own company. Lastly, and maybe most importantly, supporting a small business shows how you (as someone with his or her own identity) choose to vote with your hard-earned money.
