## Sincerely, Tommy
I'm a fashion stylist so I'm always on the lookout for new, exciting retailers and designers. A friend of mine told me about Sincerely, Tommy in Bed Stuy when I first moved to NY almost 2 years ago. The space itself is beautiful and the selection is so well curated - there’s such a great mix of new, local designers and independent brands that the owner, Kai, has come across throughout her travels all over the world. Kai’s actually a Bed Stuy native, and I think there’s something really nice about the fact that she wanted to add beauty and build her shop in a neighborhood that already holds so much significance for her.

## Stonefruit Espresso + Kitchen
I stumbled upon Stonefruit while walking home from the gym one day. They have a delicious menu of fresh and healthy foods, which I appreciate especially when I stop in after a workout. Lately I’ve been big on their monk bowl, which has black rice, seasonal vegetables, tahini, and sesame seeds. Also, I’m from LA, and the vibe of Stonefruit really reminds me of places that I used to frequent in Echo Park or Eagle Rock - I find that really comforting. I come here twice a week on average and have a hard time leaving without buying a bunch of wildflowers, which they sell in the back room alongside their coffee and delicious food. Super stoked a place like this exists in my neighborhood.

## Brooklyn Yoga Collective
Brooklyn Yoga Collective is my neighborhood yoga studio. It's cozy and the teachers are great and super personable. That’s pretty much all you need in a place you go to recharge and feel calm. 
 
## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
As I’m not originally from here, I’m constantly trying to find places that give me a feeling of belonging - things that make me feel at home. Being a regular patron of small businesses throughout the city has helped me cultivate that sense of community in New York. I think I’d question why I decided to live here if I only shopped at big chain retailers and didn’t venture out in my neighborhood to support local businesses.
