## Pete’s Clam Bar

Pete’s is on the corner of 15th and Surf; this is _the_ spot that inspired me to get into what I do. I moved to the city in ‘94 but everything really clicked for me in ‘98 when I saw their handpainted signage, which was executed with this total disregard for any kind of thematic sense. They just piled signs on signs to create this beautiful visual overload; it really showed me what art could (and should) be. Pete’s was the beginning for me and it continues to inspire me to this day - to the point where I’m currently 20 feet across the street installing an elaborate sign display based on my experience of looking at this clam bar.

## El Dorado Bumper Cars and Arcade

Another beautiful establishment that always got a lot of attention. Painting signs for El Dorado was a really difficult but rewarding experience. Scott, the owner at the time, didn’t need my services and (correctly) felt that it was a privilege for me to be working for him. I remember his directive to me was “I want signs that look like the South Bronx meets the West Village.” Who thinks of life in those terms? Scott did, and he was a really great person to have as a boss and muse - anyone who has their business thought out to that point deserves all the help they can get. The first couple of signs I painted for Scott (and I was working for free, mind you) - he thought they were terrible. I tried to argue with him but he stopped me and goes, “nah nah nah, I have bolts in my bumper cars that have to be torqued to thirty three newtons per square meter, none of this pounds per inches shit - don’t tell me what perfection looks like. I’ll come out here and paint these signs and next year you’ll see what perfection looks like.” This guy had probably never held a brush in his life, but he knew that, in his mind, if he could perceive perfection he could achieve perfection. That kind of confidence is as great as it is rare.

## Michael’s Photo Studio

Michael’s been taking photos of people and heat-transferring them onto banners and t-shirts for 28 years now. When I first saw his set-up he had a VHS film camera. He would record a few seconds of you on video, freeze a frame that looked decent, and that’s what he’d print the image from. That’s what the operation was like for the first decade. He finally switched over to a digital camera set-up not too long ago. My son and I have been getting a “HOMIES FOREVER” banner here since he was six months old. The funny thing is, though, Michael ran out of “HOMIES FOREVER” blanks like five years back. Fortunately, I was able to find a stash online so hopefully that’ll last us until my son hits adulthood (or he gets tired of this escapade). But that’s it, you know? I’m tied in to Michael’s Photo Studio for the next, say, twelve years. I’m grateful that he’s there and hope he stays around - he’s part of my family.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

It’s important to me because these people are family and they support families of their own. They’re the real texture of New York. If you’re complaining about New York changing and how it’s not this or that anymore - everything that you want from New York lives on in local businesses. If you don’t support them, you have nothing to whine about when they disappear. Go out of your way a little bit, become regulars at these spots, and support these guys...because you’re going to be mad when they’re gone. Enjoy them.
