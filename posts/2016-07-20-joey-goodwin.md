## Alidoro
The best sandwich in New York. I have been going there since I was very young and know the owners Walter and Brenda Momente well( I used to babysit their son). After a tough game at West 4th there is nothing better then a  prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich on tramezzino bread. The shop is small and there are lines out the door. Walter is affable, while Brenda is all business, but she acts as a second mother towards me. Walter started off as an aprentice to the old gruff original owner( I also knew) many years ago, but tookover and turned Alidoro into the best and one of the most popular sandwich shops in the city. Walter and I used to produce a quarky online cooking saw in my old basement entitled "Cooking in a New York Momente". Walter is an incredible cook of all dishes and should open a full service restaurant one day. Alidoro has just opened its third location at the Bowery Market, but for me nothing beats the original.

## Kenny Graham's West 4th Street Basketball Tournament
On the corner of West 4th and Sixth Avenue is "The Cage" a world famous basketball court and a microcosm on to itself.

The tournament was founded by Kenny Graham and has been running for the past 30 years funded by team entry fees. I always try to make sure we have a team entered in the tournament, because the Summer would not be the same without one. The tournament brings the best basketball players in the city to this small court in the village. I started coming down to West 4th when I was 12 or 13 and I am 31 years old now. I probably learned more about business and decision making from just hanging out here and observing different people and situations. Two of my prior businesses were actually birthed at the court. West 4th is a lot of things from the talented players of the tournament, to the urban theater of the pick up games, to the hustling on the handball courts, but it is definitely a New York institution. You'd be surprised how valuable the lessons I learned(good and bad) taught by guys named Butter, Rookie, and Heavy are when scaling a business. "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls".

## Supreme 
Supreme is a huge inspiration for Overthrow. It is amazing to see lines of kids waiting for the most recent drop. Supreme took skateboarding as a culture and was able to extend it to all different genres. I love that they were able to capture an entire downtown culture and build a cult following with very simple product.

## Why is it important to support small business?
Small businesses are important for many reasons, they stimulate the economy, create jobs,but most importantly they allow anyone with a dream , an idea, and a plan to create something special that adds value to the world.
