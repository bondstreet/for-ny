## The Blue Stove
The Blue Stove is important to me because I love each and every person who works there as much as I love sweets. Everyone there is awesome - they’re just great, solid people who are also super creative...they care in the way where they know all of their customers’ names. And probably their coffee order, as well. Each of the businesses I’ve chosen for this feature have that in common - they’re great because of how invested they are in building relationships with their supporters. Bottom line with Blue Stove is - awesome people, even better sweets. I’ve had like four birthday cakes made there including one that had a giant, dancing hot dog on it. That’s totally the best thing about independent businesses, right? You can walk in, talk to the owner about whatever your ideas are, and they’re cool to run with it. I love Blue Stove for all of those reasons.

## Human@Ease
Human@Ease is my gym, but it’s also a lot more than that. They’re awesome because, unlike a lot of larger gyms, there’s no pretension or weird intensity involved. I could very easily walk in there at 7 am with no makeup on, looking like complete garbage, and totally feel comfortable. No pressure whatsoever. These guys might be the most significant business on my list because I just went through a three month wellness program with them. It was the first time in my life where I didn’t drink for six weeks since I was...I don’t know, eighteen? Between all the weightlifting (which I’d never done before), the nutrition advice, this infrared sauna thing they have, and body treatments - they got me on a track that’s made me feel good about myself in a completely new way. It’s also a beautiful, very personally designed space. Every nook and cranny at Human@Ease has something that speaks to the gym’s character. I try to do the same thing at Paint Box - all of the design choices we’ve made at the store are reflections of our personalities. My first conversation with the owners of Human@Ease happened because we’re both independent business owners, so our entire relationship is really built off of sharing our customers and helping each other out.

## BFF Petwash
BFF is the best. Again, this is another spot that’s run by normal, regular people who value the connection and support system between independent business owners. I’m a dog person so I’m there very frequently, and it’s just nice that Ania (who owns BFF) is always down to hang out and give me treats, extra shampoo, or whatever else for my dog. I don’t know how else to put it, but BFF is just a really pure place. It’s so nice to support a business like them and see how that choice directly feeds back into the community and neighborhood. My dog loves it because he really likes getting wet, he gets constant treats when he’s there, and everyone’s a total sweetheart to him.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Because they keep our neighborhoods grounded and sustainable. Independent businesses keep money circulating in our communities, they foster connections between people, and they help creativity flourish on a local level. You could get a lot of what you find at local businesses at a Whole Foods or Equinox, but you’re never going to build the same kind of personalized experience or relationships there. Look at what’s happened to Williamsburg - no one can keep their doors open because so many big box companies are extracting money from the community and taking it elsewhere. So supporting small businesses is really you supporting the healthy growth of a neighborhood.
