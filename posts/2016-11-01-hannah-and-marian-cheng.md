## Cafe Integral
Our friend Cesar recently opened the first stand-alone location of his inviting cafe on Elizabeth. We love the idea of being able to support a friend while enjoying amazing drinks that we'd buy anyways. It’s also right around the corner from Mimi Cheng’s and it opens at 7a. The lighting in Cafe Integral is perfect for early mornings. Make sure you order a ham and cheese croissant, too - they're divine.

## Sweetgreen
We’ve been eating at and ordering from Sweetgreen since the guys opened their first location in Georgetown back in '07. It’s really incredible to watch our friends grow their dream to such an incredible scale. Their journey has played a really inspirational role for us as we continue developing Mimi Cheng's.

## Outdoor Voices
Outdoor Voices was started by our friend Tyler Haney. Basically, they make amazing street-to-workout transition gear, which is crucial for people who live in New York. We wear OV pieces a lot even when we’re not at the gym because the fabrics are super comfortable and the cuts are classic. They go great with everything.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Independent businesses have unique personalities and points of view. If we don’t support them and put our money where our mouth is, then the world would be filled with Starbucks, Duane Reades, Walmarts, and other big box businesses - that's a scary thought.
