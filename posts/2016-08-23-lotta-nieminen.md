## Burrow
Despite having had a studio in the neighborhood before, I only discovered Burrow after I leased a space in the same building: this amazing little Japanese bakery is nested in the lobby of 68 Jay Street in Dumbo. Aside from making a delicious iced coffee (with coffee ice cubes, no less!), they serve out-of-this-world pastries that not only look like little works of art, but actually taste just as amazing. My favorites are the vegan carrot cake and banana muffin, but you can also order these rad custom portrait cookies or cakes! Burrow looks and feels just as friendly as its owners. After I’d been going by for a while, the fact that I’m from Finland came up – after that conversation I started getting greeted and thanked in Finnish upon picking up my morning coffee, which I find pretty spectacular!

## Paintbox
Paintbox is a Soho nail art studio done just right. My initial connection with Paintbox was through work, as I created their visual identity for them. Upon being contacted about the project, I was immediately impressed with Eleanor’s commitment to detail and her desire to create an unbeatable service and environment for Paintbox to live in. Working for companies whose product, services, and ethos I fully believe in is crucial for me, so I’ve also been a regular customer here since day one. I love their concept of a seasonally curated list of looks: it gives you an abundance of styles to choose from, but not to the point of feeling overwhelmed. Paintbox is beautiful inside and out!

## Sunrise Mart
Sunrise Mart became a regular haunt for my husband and I after our trip to Japan last year. Looking to recreate the chirashi-dons we ate there almost daily, we started getting our groceries from here. Coming from Finland, I’m pretty picky when it comes to fish, and theirs is always fresh and reasonably priced - not a given in New York! They also seem to have some kind of magic avocado stash, as I’ve never not gotten a perfectly ripe one. I go in for savory ingredients but always end up grabbing something from their sweets section (that I really only pick based on looks) - Japanese packaging design is the bomb! I mostly visit the Soho location due to convenience, but love the East Village one with their selection of beautiful Japanese plates and bowls!

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
The connection you create with a small business can’t really be rivaled  - the products and care they offer feel more special, more intimate, and more meaningful. These are all companies that I feel contribute to the development of a more interesting, personal community, and determine the actual look and feel of a city. As someone who runs her own independent business, I see the risk and passion that intertwine in the cultivation of a small company - taking those chances is something worth supporting. You get to be a contributor to the realization of someone else’s dream!
