 (co-founder - The Meatball Shop, founder - Seamore’s)

Ken
So there’s this spot on the corner of Broome and Elizabeth - I rolled up on it out of the blue while I was trying to figure out how to get a neon sign made for Seamore’s. I don’t think it even has a name and the place looks like an absolute madhouse, but the guy who runs it is an old school Chinese dude named Ken who’s the most knowledgeable, meticulous person I’ve ever met. It’s unbelievable. This guy builds everything and just holds it down for the whole neighborhood. He does awnings, makes neon signs, cuts vinyl, does custom wraps, steel frames - you name it. He could probably build a building if you asked him to do it or take apart a car and piece it back together. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if he just came in here and ran the line at Seamore’s one day. To date, he’s helped me out with the neon I mentioned earlier, the metal frames that separate our sidewalk cafe from the sidewalk, the hanger up there on the wall for our merch...like I said, Ken is a guy who just handles shit. He’s the best.

Soho Strength Lab
Soho Strength Lab is where I get my sweat on. The trainers in there are super elite - they put me to WORK. It’s conveniently located right across the street from Seamore’s so I’m able to pop in there whenever I want and get my fucking beast on. I’ve been going there for over a year since we opened the restaurant, and the crew just keeps me in shape. That’s it. It’s amazing. Strength Lab is personal trainers only - I’d never worked out with a trainer before I started going there. So. I do spend a little dough on it, but it’s worth every cent because whenever I walk in I come out a better man.

Happy Bones
Happy Bones is right next door - they actually share this wall with Seamore’s and it’s the best coffee spot around. The guys who opened it up are all cool, extremely humble dudes. At this point we’re like family...we support each other fully - they send people to us, we send people to them. Good vibes, good people, good coffee. I’ve never had a bad espresso there, the atmosphere is always low-key and regular, and the majority of people who drink coffee in this neighborhood pop into Happy Bones for a reason. Also, Jason, the owner, is an old school friend of mine - we used to work together back in the day. He’s an amazing artist who travels all over the world painting these sick murals. All about supporting homies in the neighborhood.

Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Because if I didn’t support independent businesses, I could never expect independent businesses to support me. It’s all about family and representing for each other - if you need a cup of milk or a spoonful of sugar, I got you. Knock on the door and we’re always here for you, 24/7. The more we can do that, the better off we’ll all be as a community. 

As someone who grew up in New York City, a lot of spots I’d always go to aren’t there anymore...and it’s definitely interesting to see what new businesses have come in to replace them. Big business is scary. I grew up in Manhattan and live in Williamsburg now, and it’s just insane to see all of these corporate spots open up all over Bedford. The grocery store around the corner? It’s a wrap as soon as Whole Foods came in. Doesn’t matter what anyone does or says - that’s it. You might as well pack your bags when you see that sign. It’s a very real problem - it’s hard enough running an independent business as is, but once a company backed with billions of dollars comes around, they’ll wipe you out. 

That said, there’s also something to be said about being great. You can’t hate someone for being great - if a business comes around and just kills it because they know what they’re doing, you have to respect that in a certain way. So, my advice to independent business owners like me is don’t focus on what other people are doing, focus on being great. If you’re great, you have nothing to worry about - if you’re good, it’s a wrap. Take Seamore’s, for example - fish tacos aren’t anything new - if people don’t like mine they just won’t come back. They’ll just go to Rosa Mexicano or wherever. So my focus at Seamore’s is to make the greatest fish taco I can - if that’s on point, people will come through, and I’m happy. Simple.
