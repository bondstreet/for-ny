## Crossfit South Brooklyn
This is where I spend my mornings.  In order to eat massive amounts of ice cream I need to burn massive amounts of calories. The best way to do this is to build muscle and that's what crossfit helps folks to achieve.  With olympic moves such as the Clean and Jerk-it makes me feel like a champion.  The owner David has created a real communal environment  Also, the trainers are super helpful and patient and David is always creating cool events for both the crossfit community as well as the neighborhood.
 
## Baba's Pierogies
Who doesn't like a good pierogi?  When Jackie and I first visited Baba's we thought we'd hit the jackpot of amazing lunch spots in Gowanus.  We went there almost every day for a while.  Their menu is great.  They have really diverse options.  I love the bacon cheddar pierogies.  Get them fried and they're even better.   They also have these great fried schnitzel bites.  A combo of pork and chicken, breaded and fried.  Jackie likes their spinach & feta pierogies.  Helena and Robert are always super welcoming.  I think they created a great neighborhood pierogi spot that will be around for years to come.
 
## No Relation Vintage
This place is huge, colorful and fun.  It's a vintage clothes seekers paradise and it's a perfect distraction from work.  Whenever I'm in need of some shopping therapy, I will secretly sneak over and rifle through each colorful rack searching for cute outfits.  What's awesome about No Relation is that they are constantly getting new and  interesting shipments so there's always something different to find and buy.  Of course the icing on the cake here is that  their vintage dresses range in price from $8-$20.  Last week I bought three outfits for under $50!  I even bought the dress I'm wearing in this photo.
