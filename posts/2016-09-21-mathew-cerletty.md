## Mitchell Algus Gallery
It took me 5 years in the art world to find out about Mitchell Algus. He’s the eccentric genius curator that all the true believers follow. He fights for under-appreciated artists and a more complicated, less market-driven interpretation of culture in New York. Despite being a natural contrarian, he’s warm and generous with his time and ideas. If I’m excited about an artist, he’ll show me 3 people that made better work 20 years earlier. His group shows always tell new stories full of deep cuts and familiar artists in surprising contexts. The art world can be soul crushing sometimes, and it’s rare that a gallery feels so creative and personal...real art for real people!

## Pacific Aquarium
Next time you’re walking on Delancey keep an eye out for Pacific Aquarium. It’s a magical respite from the street filled with perfect little glowing worlds. When I was a kid I was obsessed with my aquarium and trying to combine the right fish, plants, lighting...a hobby not unlike making meticulous paintings. They have hundreds of colorful fish in tanks stacked up to the ceiling and a few very impressive show tanks scattered around the store. I highly recommend this shop to anyone that likes stimulating visuals, even if you aren’t in the market for a pet. They also unexpectedly sell fishing equipment in case you feel like catching your own.

## Trophy Bar
Trophy Bar is my go-to, crowd-pleasing local. I stopped in by myself when they first opened and was charmed by the owner that was tending bar. He asked me if I wanted to try a Verdita which turned out to be a shot of tequila and a green chaser made of cilantro, mint, jalapeno and pineapple juice. I’ve been singing its praises ever since. The bar itself has everything you might want—bright back garden, good food, all the typical fancy cocktails and beer. They get the basics right and allow for a full range of experiences from a quiet drink with a friend all the way to sweaty dance party.   

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Small businesses usually bring more humanity—reflecting the people that run the place and the culture of their community. It’s exciting to see the little quirks and enthusiasms of people in their work, even if it’s unrelated to the business. I love that my laundromat has a wall covered in pro wrestling posters because the owner is obsessed or that my local deli workers want to talk about the election. Corporate branding and behavior can be convenient, but it’s also reassuring to be reminded that we’re surrounded by unique individuals.
