## Sei-Tomoko

Sei-Tomoko is Ssäm Bar's next door neighbor, and it's where I've been getting my haircut for years. I love what they do.

## Superiority Burger 
Long story short, I love this place because Brooks Headley and his team rule. NYC needs more of it.

## Nalata Nalata 
Hands down, my favorite store in NYC. It eases my itch for all things Japanese-crafted.
