## Sei-Tomoko

Sei-Tomoko is Ssäm Bar's next door neighbor, and it's where I've been getting my haircut for years. They've expanded to a few locations, but still offer the same great service they offered back when they first opened. They take pride in everything they do and know their craft.

## Superiority Burger

Long story short, I love this place because Brooks Headley and his team rule. I've always been a fan. Brooks has a distinct point of view, isn't afraid to explore new ideas, and reflects this in everything he does. NYC needs more of it.

## Nalata Nalata

Hands down, my favorite store in NYC. It eases my itch for all things Japanese-crafted. They're not out to just sell awesome, quality products. They also try to educate buyers about the craftsmen and stories behind the products.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I can say this from the restaurant industry’s perspective: I think small businesses are fucking vital to the lifeblood. If you don't have a younger crop of chefs or general managers wanting to sort of kill their mentors, then the whole fucking system collapses.
