## CW Pencil Enterprise
Being an old school cat, it surprises me whenever I come across something in the city that has a little bit of magic in it. CW has that magic. Who thinks of something like that, right? “I’m going to open a store in the LES in 2016 and just sell pencils and erasers sourced from all over the world.” Coming across this hidden gem gave me great hope; it made me realize that I am indeed able to chase the craziest dreams that I have at this moment. With everything being so technology-driven today, it’s essential that we continue to embrace writing, drawing, and all of these extremely visceral skillsets that the world seems to largely be ok with neglecting.

To that end, the people who work at CW are really inspiring to me as well - Alex, who was behind the desk when we walked in today - she’s a writer. And she writes all of her first drafts by hand! Like I said earlier, that truly gives me hope - it makes me believe that we can and will retain these wonderful skills that I grew up learning in school, whether it’s calligraphy, crafting letters, or even something as simple as scribbling notes down on a pad instead of on your phone.

## Dashwood Books
I’ve been visiting Dashwood regularly for years - as the owner, David, said when we walked in, “don’t I remember you coming in that one time and just doing a ton of damage?” He was referring to this one day a few years ago where I just decided to buy a ton of books for my close friends. This spot has such a beautiful selection of information - they find the leading voices from all corners of culture and history that people need to be exposed to. On the other end of the spectrum, Dashwood is also a trove of incredibly obscure works - so anytime you walk in you can lose yourself in this fantastic range of perspective-expanding media. In turn, that experience hopefully acts as a launch pad for the generation of your own ideas. I’m not talking about copying what someone else is doing - rather, you should find yourself inspired to pursue projects that might otherwise seem unrealistic. Say you want to do something like photograph a one-legged soccer player in Bangladesh or something like that - there’s a book at Dashwood that will undoubtedly help you realize that the scope of your ambition is achievable.

I’d also like to mention that everyone who works here is so welcoming; they really give you the opportunity to digest everything at your own pace. Books make great gifts because they represent the exchange of ideas - every time I stop by Dashwood I try to find something for a friend or family member.

## Perla Cafe
Lastly, we’re sitting at one of my favorite restaurants in the city, Perla Cafe. There’s a gentleman named Gabe Stulman who’s been a dear friend of mine for four years. He allowed me to be a part owner of Fedora, another one of his establishments that’s diagonally across the street from here. As part of this arrangement, he let me curate the restaurant - anything on the wall is either a photo that I took, a photo that inspired me, or a work from an artist who I admire (from Charming Baker to Neil Leifer’s Muhammad Ali piece to Ben Watts and so on). What’s beautiful about this dynamic is that we always make sure the art is changing and responsive to what’s going on.

When Gabe opened Perla, he extended me the same offer that he did with Fedora. As such, my contribution as part owner of this restaurant has been to, again, curate the look and feel of the space. We’re sitting next to one of my prints of the mighty Yasiin Bey, aka Mos Def. I was doing a project with artists where I wanted to see what their contributions to my portraits of them would be if I gave them free reign and every drawing utensil imaginable. Mos, naturally, wrote so beautifully about the origin of his name. This is one of ten prints of that piece in the world. In choosing the works that hang at Perla and Fedora, I really wanted people to be able to experience art of this quality in a context that feels a little more physical, tangible, and a bit closer to home.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
People who strike out to run their own businesses share one thing - an incomparable passion for what they do and the product they deliver. A burger that I have at Perla is probably going to be the best one I’ve had in months because they care that much more. Independent business owners hone their passion and energy by diligently studying craft and taking the time to perfect their wares. They bring together all of these elements and present the resultant package to the audience as a complete, coherent thought. In doing this, they give something back to the community and manage to elevate culture. That’s why I’ll always support people who take that leap of faith - they tend to grow wings on the way down.
