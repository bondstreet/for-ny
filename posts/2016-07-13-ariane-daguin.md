## Gourmet Garage
I’ve known Andy, the owner of Gourmet Garage, for years because he’s a D’artagnan client. I always try to convince him to buy certain things, but he’s got his own ideas so we find ourselves in heated debates quite often! I love the fact that he’s persevered and is still doing well despite how corporate players are completely overwhelming the food retail space. I suppose I’d call Gourmet Garage the biggest of the little guys - it’s really admirable to me that Andy can occupy this niche...his brand is so distinct, which is what will ultimately allow him to persist and survive. Whether you’re conscious of it or not, at Gourmet Garage you’ll always be exposed to a selection of produce and food that is diverse, fairly priced, and curated with a distinct point of view. That’s what I attribute their longevity to.

## Ladurée
Ladurée arrived in New York a few years ago, but in France it is obviously a big, family-run operation that has an extremely strong legacy around it. Normally, heritage businesses like Ladurée are run very conservatively in France. Conversely, these guys are extremely dynamic in their decision-making and international expansion. That isn’t to say that they aren’t extremely pragmatic as well; they did significant market research and figured out exactly where and how they needed to make an impact here. Their attention to detail is second to none - you can clearly see that when you walk through their incredible West Broadway space. My family and friends will have very lively brunches in the garden quite often.

## Felix
Aha, Felix. What can I say about Felix? The chef, Pierre, makes these really mean buffalo wings. We’ll try some shortly. Pierre is one of my oldest customers in the city and is from the same region, the southwest of France, as I am. Because we share these roots, there’s a shorthand between us - we’ve never had to explain things to each other. He knows exactly what I mean and vice versa. I’ve always admired how hard Pierre works while still being passionate about his craft and having fun with it. I want to make it very clear that Pierre is a true bistro chef - he brings very traditional dishes made perfectly. To the T. That isn’t actually as common a thing in New York or the States as people might think. Pierre will sometimes call us up and say, “hey I have sweetbreads tonight” or something like that, and we’ll all rush over to see what he’s come up with. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Let me put it this way - in my business, it is essential for me to promote sustainable practices and biodiversity. If you neglect certain species or breeds of animals, the entire ecosystem collapses. American bison, for instance, were on the verge of extinction until it was decided that they could be raised for meat. Suddenly, you see the population bounce back into healthy numbers and the environment becomes more balanced for it. Look at what’s happening to bees, now. Individually, bees are tiny! What impact could they make on anything bigger than themselves? And yet, if bees die out, what pollinates plants? 

I’m sorry to make comparisons between animals and independent business owners, but I feel that the metaphor works! If you don’t support independent businesses, things become imbalanced. We invariably end up with towns that look like homogenous malls full of the same boring stuff. Without diversity, there’s no reason to leave your home. There’s nothing new or interesting to experience. To keep the interaction between economy, communities, and culture healthy, you must support the little guys.
