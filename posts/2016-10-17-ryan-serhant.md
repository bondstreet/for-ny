## The Dogpound
The Dogpound is significant to me for two reasons - one, being completely honest - it’s the location: they’re right across the street from where I live. Them being here, specifically, validated a lot of my thinking when I bought my place down on Renwick a few years ago. This was when everyone else in real estate was like, “what? That’s a dead zone - it’s not Soho, it’s not Tribeca.” Six months later, The Dogpound - whose members include Hugh Jackman, Nigel Barker, and numerous high-profile models - opens up on that corner and now you’ve got this whole neighborhood popping up around it. 

Secondly, there’s a community and atmosphere at Dogpound that’s unlike any other gym I’ve been a part of before. I think it’s because Dogpound isn’t class-oriented. There are tons of people who love their Soulcycles, Barry’s, Flywheels - all of that. Then there are folks who are into what Equinox and David Barton represent - but to me those are gyms that just have really specific aesthetic leanings. When you’re at Dogpound, you have to work out with somebody. It’s the same group of trainers all the time at the one location, so there’s essentially this built-in sense of camaraderie the moment you step in. It’s hard to describe, but it feels like being part of a very specific club. it’s also just a great place to meet people and they open really early, too, which is always helpful for me.

## Jeremy Argyle
I met the owner of Jeremy Argyle, Brian Guttman, several years ago through my best friend Caleb Petersen, who is a commercial retail broker. He introduced me to Brian because he’d helped them with that lease and a few other spaces, as well. I just kind of fell in love with their product. And it’s all very simple, right? You can buy shirts anywhere, both online and off; at big businesses and small ones. But the shirts at Jeremy Argyle are very customized - they pay attention to all the details, and they feel better and fit better than any shirt I’ve ever worn. For me, that makes all the difference because I have to wear a button-down shirt to work every day. 

You also have to consider how long they’ve been in the neighborhood, considering how insane Soho leases are. To have a store in the middle of Soho is no easy thing. It’s a testament to the quality of their product and brand. Obviously, because the vast majority of what they sell is shirts, if that wasn’t working for them they’d have been phased out years ago.

## The Serhant Team
Recently, we had the opening party for my team’s new office in Bed Stuy. Nest Seekers is the brokerage I work for - they’re the umbrella. Then I have agents working under me to help handle my business. My main office is in Soho, but because we’ve been so active in Brooklyn (specifically Bed Stuy and Bushwick) over the past year, I finally pushed to open a location here. Some of that was driven by the fact that there wasn’t already a Nest Seekers location (or an office for any major, reputable brokerage, really) in the neighborhood - but it was also unfair to ask my team to constantly go back and forth between Bed Stuy and Soho every day. 

So, yeah, we opened up this office and are having a lot of fun with it. My friend, Taylor Spellman, who is an incredible interior designer with her own Bravo show on the way, totally decked out the space for us. One of the bathrooms, for instance, is lined with all of our sold listings - we’ll just keep adding to that over the years. The other one has this crazy wallpaper with pinup girls, sharks, and machine guns all over it. Obviously. 

At the end of the day, we’re a small business, as well. It’s a commissions-based brokerage for townhouses, condos, and multi-family properties. We’re growing with the neighborhood.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Because independent businesses are the lifeblood of the United States. Without them, larger businesses simply can’t exist. And then you’d never have the reciprocal relationship where corporations and smaller businesses influence each other in a constructive way.

That’s the theory our economy is built on, right? Ideally, small businesses grow into larger ones, which then allows for other entrepreneurs to plant themselves and seize on new opportunities to be creative. And it’s so important to support the latter because they’re not encumbered in the same way that corporations are - they’re not beholden to hierarchy, bureaucracy, or shareholders. As such, they have the ability to do interesting, riskier things and bring new ideas to the table. 

Also -  I’ll often find that the quality, service, and product offered by independent businesses is simply better than the alternative. I’d argue that’s largely because they have a reputation to build, as opposed to just having one to uphold. So whether you’re making shirts, training people at your gym, or doing what I do, independent businesses provide customers with experiences that you can’t get anywhere else.
