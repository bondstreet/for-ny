## Smith & Mills 

Tribeca bar.  Bauhaus meets constructivist.  Reclaimed wood, soft lighting, moody feel.  We go for the bespoke classics like the Vesper.  Small bites, charcuterie and oysters.  Open, breezy front during warm weather.  Wuthering Heights comfort in foul weather.

## Terroir Tribeca 

Paul Grieco's ode to riesling, grower-champagne and lamb sausage.  Cheeky.  Like the high school kid who sneezed loud on purpose.  We go to see what fun, off-beat wines are being poured and to have some deviled eggs...and my catch the scores from The Premier League.


## Grounded Coffee House 

Local baristas who don't give you a hard time if you want to add ice to a latte.  Great tea and coffee selection.  Literary, low key vibe- makes you want to relax and read the Times and let the day pass.
