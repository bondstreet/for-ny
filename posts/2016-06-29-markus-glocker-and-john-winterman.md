## Smith & Mills

Tribeca bar.  Bauhaus meets constructivist.  Reclaimed wood, soft lighting, moody feel.  We go for the bespoke classics like the Vesper.  Small bites, charcuterie and oysters.  Open, breezy front during warm weather.  Wuthering Heights comfort in foul weather.

## Terroir Tribeca (or Highline)
24 Harrison St, New York, NY 10013
Paul Grieco's ode to riesling, grower-champagne and lamb sausage.  Cheeky.  Like the high school kid who sneezed loud on purpose.  We go to see what fun, off-beat wines are being poured and to have some deviled eggs...and my catch the scores from The Premier League.

## Bonsignour
A snug, charmer of a little coffee place on Jane St, on an unashamedly cute corner.  If you were looking for a "Mayberry" style spot in the West Village, you can find it here.  Everyone seems to know each other and the staff is always ready with a smile and a wave.

## Why is it important to support independent business?

Local businesses are personal and welcoming.  The staff take the time to get to know you.  Sometimes it is great to walk in and have someone ask, "the usual?"  Even if you don't want "the usual," the familiarity is comforting.  To Markus and me, the word homogeneity, has horrible connotations - that of a drab, conformist city with programmed tastes.  Character is lost, personal vision is lost, rent goes up.  We love small, intimate, neighborhood spots like the ones mentioned.
