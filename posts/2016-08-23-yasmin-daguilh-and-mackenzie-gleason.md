## Dillinger’s
Y: This place fills a void in the neighborhood for me. In New York you can get accustomed to certain luxuries, and having good food and good coffee within a 10 minute roll from my house has become one of them. Dillinger’s provides exactly that. It’s just a legitimate place making legitimately good breakfast and lunch. They also have homemade Russian dumplings all the time and an amazing backyard - how do you say no to any of that?

M: The seemingly endless search for the perfect, quiet, delicious, and consistent cafe in walking distance from home ended the second I walked into Dillinger’s. A big part of why I’m attracted to certain smaller businesses is the people involved. Interactions with the staff at a restaurant has the ability to make already great food even better; this is absolutely the case at Dillinger’s.

## L Train Vintage
Y: I can’t even explain all the ways that I cherish L Train Vintage. When I map out my six years in NYC, the one constant is L Train, and I’m fine with that. It has all the wonders of a down south GoodWill organized with the curatorial eye of a Fresh Prince of Bel Air costumier. My personal style is 90s cult film extra, so it goes without saying that L Train is my Mecca. They have everything from Air Force Ones to military grade jumpsuits to every single style of Levis created. Almost everything goes for $5-$20, so no regrets on purchasing that sequined pantsuit.

M: I’m not someone who seeks out L Train to find things that I love, but I do love all the things that I’ve gotten from this place. There are a lot of pieces that have become staples in my closet that without L Train - and Yasmin - I wouldn’t own. Especially my denim jacket that has become my favorite custom piece thanks to the great people at Schafmayer & Co.

## Schafmayer & Co.
Y: Schafmayer & Co is one of those uniquely specific stores that you never knew you needed, but you always wanted to exist. Custom embroidery, limited edition patches, and a whole slew of slightly dark and dangerous knick-knacks...all of that makes it easy to keep coming back. Plus, they have pop-up art shows and an amazing old couch.

M: The thread between the three businesses we chose is how the people and product involved connect. 

Schafmayer holds a special place in my heart. It was introduced to me by a friend and it’s quickly become a favorite place to spend my time and money. Filled with leather jackets, patches, knives, taxidermy, and custom embroidery work done by the shop’s owner Amanda, it’s every metal head’s dream! This store embodies and personifies New York’s “by any means necessary” mentality. It was broken into not long ago and Amanda and the girls lost a lot of inventory, but what would’ve ruined most didn’t stop them. It’s that type of can-do resilience that I admire in her and all small business owners.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Y: I grew up in Haiti where every business is an independent business. To me, independent businesses feel like home; someone knows your name, or at least recognizes your face, and you sense a realness in that place that you don’t feel with chains and big brands. Independent businesses are the backbone of the United States and, frankly, the local places in New York are part of what makes the city alive.

M: My father was born in Brooklyn and spent a large portion of his childhood in the Bronx - my mom was raised in the LES. I’ve spent my entire life in New York, so I have a real serious relationship with the city, especially now that I live here myself. Small businesses and the people who own them are the heart and soul of this city. We all need to do our part to continue to support local businesses - without them, this place wouldn’t feel like home.
