## Junior’s Cheesecake

Junior’s is a Brooklyn classic. There are several other Junior’s outposts in NYC but this one is the original. It’s known for cheesecake but more than that the real main attraction there is people watching!

## The Little Sweet Cafe

The Little Sweet Cafe is both little and sweet! They also make an excellent crepe, but no computers allowed! :)  There are only about 5 tables so i am always pleased when i can snag the window seat.

## Steven Alan

Steven Alan has been a favorite of mine for years.  They always have a well-edited selection of the brands I am interested in; plus, I’ve been wearing the shirts from their eponymous label since I started working in fashion. Now I buy menswear staples for my husband here, too. Somehow, everything they make seems to check the boxes for casual and polished.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Independent businesses are a big part of what makes living in NYC special! I mean, I love to stare at my various screens just as much as the next gal, but getting off your butt, walking around your neighborhood and checking out the sights, sounds, smells and people in the real world is sometimes just as important as what's on your phone. ;)
