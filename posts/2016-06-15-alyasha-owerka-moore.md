## Hot Dog and Knish Stands

I feel like those kinds of businesses are what the city was built on. The dirty water dog and the knish with smothered onions and spicy mustard are New York mainstays...to see vendors get taxed so heavily and exploited from so many angles is really frustrating to see. It’s tough to watch them disappear because a 7 Eleven needs to get put in. So many people take them for granted because there was a time where these stands really were pretty ubiquitous. Think about how many cats fed their families selling hot dogs and knishes. Whether it’s an old Polish cat, a Middle Eastern cat, or a Korean cat...I grew up seeing everyone who got off a boat or plane put their lives together selling hot dogs. It sucks to see them vanishing.

## Junior’s Cheesecake

I’m a nostalgia nerd. Junior’s has been around forever. When my mom and I moved to the city in ‘77, we could walk there from our old pad so it kind of holds a special place in my memories. Obviously, it’s still family owned. Whenever there was a reason for celebration, whether it was something at school or a birthday, the two of us - cuz it was only the two of us - we’d always go and share a slice of cheesecake.

## Otto’s Shrunken Head

I grew up in the hip hop scene, the punk scene, and the New York hardcore scene. I had a friend named Dan who moved here from San Diego via the Midwest - he was in a really good band called Thin Man. He was like, “man I’m moving to New York in two weeks” and I told him I’d take him up and down Avenue A and go to all the punk bars that I grew up with - ones with really good jukeboxes and all that. Turns out, they were all gone. All of them had flipped into real bridge and tunnel douchebag bars. We walked from Houston all the way up A and everything had closed. So we get to 14th and I’m like, “fuck,” so I wound up taking Dan to Otto’s. Otto’s isn’t that old but it’s kind of the last place where I can go hear garage rock or traditional skinhead reggae or go to a rockabilly night. Maybe even a crazy goth night. The cats that might have been in the St. Mark’s crowd in the ‘80s, they’re there. Otto’s is an important piece of New York that’s holding out; it’s the last bastion of something that’s truly New York to me.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Independent businesses have made the city what it is since forever - it’s why people came here to begin with; to start their own thing. “If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere,” you know? So why come to New York if the conditions are such that you can’t possibly start your own thing anymore? Why come to New York just to fall in line? Because it’s more ‘exciting’ here? Stay at home in fuckin’ Witchita or wherever - it’s easier to stay on the treadmill out there, I promise. Independent businesses are what make the city diverse, unique, and interesting...if we don’t protect them, we just become an unnecessarily difficult version of any other town.
