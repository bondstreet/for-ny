## NYC Pet
NYC Pet is a great local pet store in Williamsburg. It’s where I purchase food, supplies, and toys for my two cats, but even more importantly, they also host adoption events for cats and dogs on most weekends throughout the year. They also have one of the prettiest cats ever (Minnie) who is an actual fairy princess, as you can see from her purple wings.

## Concrete + Water
Concrete + Water is a clothing boutique (for both men and women) that recently opened up around the corner from my studio. It’s owned by a lovely couple, JD and Hannah Gluckstern - they support a lot of up and coming designers (such as NOMIA and KARA bags, among others!) and they have an awesome backyard with a ping pong table that they’ve been hosting a bunch of fun events in.

## Enid’s
Enid's is probably my favorite local bar and snack spot in Williamsburg. I once spent an entire Saturday there, which culminated in ordering dinner and then staying for Hip Hop night until closing. They have a great veggie burger and really awesome bartenders. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Small and/or independent businesses really set the tone of a neighborhood, especially when they have brick and mortar presences in their communities. These establishments are reflections of what happens when you invest in your immediate surroundings. Lately, I’ve been thinking more and more about how important it is to use your money as an extension of your voice, for what you believe in, and want to support. To that end, I’ve been trying to educate myself about the products I purchase and where/how they are manufactured or sourced. It’s much easier to do that when you have a direct relationship with the people selling those things to you - and the stakes for those business owners are much more personal, as well.
