## Kum Kau

When I moved to Clinton Hill, all my neighbors immediately recommended the same spot: Kum Kau. I'm Chinese (no doubt), but I grew up with a real soft spot for the kind of "Chinese food" that consisted of lunch-counter stuff covered in sweet and sour glaze. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as a Kung Pao shrimp and pork fried rice dinner special. Kum Kau is the best of its kind, and has been doing it right since 1971. I’m part of the neighborhood cult now, and better off because of it.

## Sisters

For the most part, I’m wary of bars that are too “designed” — it’s like, how am I supposed to get all mellow when I’m basically sitting in an Anthropologie showroom, you know? Sisters not only looks really nice, it also feels really nice to be at, too. It’s pretty without being pretentious; they serve some really fancy, delicious cocktails, but no one will look at you funny if you ask for a beer-and-shot special. I have a tendency here to roll up during an empty Saturday afternoon and accidentally stay until closing.

## Yo-C

I started coming to Yo-C just because it was the nearest hair salon to my old apartment, but my laziness ended up paying off. Yoshi and his staff are meticulous about hair. I swear he cuts each follicle one at a time and paints each strand individually — and for proof of his technique, I just have to look at the state of his entire staff’s hair. They’ve literally all got the platonic ideal of what hair should look like (I mean, look at this pic of his partner, Rieko http://www.yo-csalon.com/index.php?&module=staff). This is also the least important part of it all, but I also really appreciate how incredibly nice and non-judgmental they are about the state of my bird’s nest any time I go in. It’d be very easy to berate me about not owning a brush, but Yoshi and co. have never once made me feel like anything short of a queen.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I support independent businesses because I know how tough it is to stay above water in this city. Plus, I love looking at other people's baby and dog photos, especially when I'm ordering Chinese food, sitting at a bar, or getting my hair cut.
