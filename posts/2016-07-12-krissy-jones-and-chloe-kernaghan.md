## Dimes
Dimes is our go-to spot for pretty much everything! We have meals there, we pick up groceries, and we also sell their packaged to-go foods here at SKY TING! Alissa and Sabrina, the owners and co-founders of Dimes, are our pals and we love the vibe of their space and quality of their food.

## CAP Beauty
The founders of CAP, Kerrilynn and Cindy have been our students for a long time. When they launched CAP Beauty, we were insta-fans. We love getting facials there and are big advocates of their products. We don’t put any chemicals on our skin, so it’s nice to have a store to go to where you trust all the ingredients of every product on the shelf.

## Rachel Comey
Rachel Comey is our guilty retail pleasure. We love shopping there, and the space is so beautiful. This is hands-down our favorite spot to visit when we need to look cute! We love how Rachel’s pieces are sophisticated, fun, and always a little artsy.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
There’s more transparency with smaller businesses as far as the how/where/why products are made, as well as what your money is going towards. You can almost always guarantee that an independent business will generate a higher quality product, or at least a product that has been made with care and thought. Plus - it’s so amazing to be able to build relationships with the people you’re giving your money to! And, as small business owners ourselves, we know the power and beauty of creating a strong community!
