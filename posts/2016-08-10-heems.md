## Kabab King
Kabab King reminds me of somewhere like Punjabi Deli in the city. I remember us campaigning for Punjabi Deli to get a taxi stand placed out front and to get construction sped up so it could stay open. Kabab King kind of runs with the same concept - cheap, good food and tea for cab drivers who work long hours. There’s nothing cool or trendy about it - the decor isn’t anything to marvel at. But a lot of upscale, fancier places lack the soul you get from a good comfort food spot, and Kabab King definitely has that. It’s also the only place where i can get paan - you know, with the betel leaf - so whenever I’m in Jackson Heights I gotta stop by there, grab some paan for my parents, grab some kabab, say hi to all the uncles, and keep it moving. You walk in, you go, “hi uncle!” and they go “who the fuck is this kid? Eat your kabab and get out of here.” But that’s what you want, right? You need to get checked. You can’t stay checking yourself. Your parents stay doing that steady but sometimes you need an uncle to check you. Kind of like when you’re trying to bond with a cabbie and he goes, “just speak English, asshole.”

## Patel Brothers
Yeah, man. Patel Brothers is just your standard grocery stuff. We don’t really fuck with Stop n Shop or anything like that. It’s all Patel Brothers, Maharaja Grocery, Subzi Mandi, and Apna Bazaar - those are the four staples out in Queens and Long Island. They’re out in Bellerose, where I grew up, in Flushing, where I was born, and so that’s where you go when you want anything from vegetables or mangos when it’s mango season to industrial grade coconut oil. I actually didn’t even know they had that until today. This particular Patel Brothers is cool because it has a weird Whole Foods looking sign outside, but the text underneath the logo says “our food...our culture.” It’s the FUBU of grocery stores. Some other Patel Brothers locations will say like, “FARMER’S MARKET,” as if to be like, “please, white people! Come!” This one is like, hey man, fuck you - this is our shit.

## Indian Sari Palace
ISP. That’s the fabric spot. What people don’t realize is that saris are straight fabrics. If you open my mom’s closet you’ll see yards and yards of fabric bought off the roll. When my parents first came here, there weren’t a lot of places where you could buy Indian stuff. So if you were looking for groceries? Jackson Heights. You needed a sari for a wedding? Jackson Heights. Gold jewelry for the in-laws? Jackson Heights. As more Indian people have done the run from Flushing, Jackson Heights, to Bellerose, to Hicksville, to New Hyde Park, more and more spots have opened up for the community so you don’t have to come around here as much. But that doesn’t take away from Jackson Heights being first. It was the spot where you’d bring relatives visiting from India; even if they were coming to see Times Square, they’d also want to see the Indian market, you know? I remember visiting France with my family back in the day - all we ate at were Indian restaurants. I was like, “yo, I didn’t come to France to eat Indian food,” but looking back on it as an adult, that was kind of an incredible way to see Europe. You got to talk to the waiters and ask how they got there, when they got there, how many of us are there in Paris, and so on. Anyways, Jackson Heights has that same identity complex that I relate to, so it’s always felt most like home to me.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I’m an independent musician, so I relate in a lot of ways to what independent business owners go through. I feel like, as Jackson Heights changes, we will eventually see a Whole Foods here. A lot of family spots will be shut down when a Duane Reade opens up. I don’t want that to happen - not on some ultra-protective shit, but just because it fundamentally changes the backbone of the neighborhood. All we got is this one street - 74th street - and if we don’t support what we have, it’ll just become what Williamsburg has turned into. 

None of this is to say that I have more of a claim on anything than anyone else - New York is fundamentally about change. Gentrification probably will find its way to Jackson Heights in the not too distant future. But I want that balance. If I ever moved here, it wouldn’t be because of convenience or proximity to the city, it’d be because I treasure the nostalgia that Jackson Heights evokes for me. I’d never want it to lose that nostalgic quality. These businesses are run by families just like mine. We call small businesses the backbone of the economy, but they’re equally backbones of culture as well. That’s why maintaining them is so important to me.
