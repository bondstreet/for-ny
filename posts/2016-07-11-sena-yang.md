## Procell
Procell is my go-to spot for the best curated selection of vintage clothing in New York. Brian Procell has an amazing eye and has put together an impeccable selection of styles that originate from the 80's to the early aughts. Every piece in there brings me so much joy and inspiration. Going through each rack is like taking a stroll through memory lane - that experience always reminds me of why I love to do what I do. Whenever I stop by Procell, it's like stepping into the happiest time machine.

## Overthrow Boxing Club
I really love the attitude and energy of this place. As the designer of an activewear line, working out is a pretty significant part of my life; I visit Overthrow to box and reenergize. The club has a strong sense of community and it is definitely the most creative fitness studio I've ever been to. I also appreciate how aesthetically clear the brand is - you can see they’re all about the details through things like these beautiful custom-printed wraps and gloves made by their in-house artist. There's even a photo studio upstairs run by one of the instructors. Overthrow is loud, fearless, and in your face, but it also has plenty of heart and integrity - that’s what ultimately keeps me coming back.

## Pies ’n’ Thighs
When I moved to Brooklyn over a decade ago, Pies ‘n’ Thighs quickly became one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. My order is pretty much the same thing every time - a Chicken Box with Mac n' Cheese doused in hot sauce with one of their glorious, buttery biscuits on the side. The crew there keeps things simple and to the point, which is what I love about it. Just the essentials. One of the toughest things about leaving Brooklyn for Manhattan was distancing myself from this establishment, but thankfully they opened an LES location that's even closer to my new apartment than the original was to my last place. Win win all around.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
As the daughter of Korean immigrants, I've been surrounded by small business owners my entire life. Growing up, that’s actually the only way I understood that you could make a living in this world. The camaraderie between my parents’ friends always stuck with me - it was an unspoken expectation that everyone looked out for each other and would be there to help you out. Again, this wasn’t really because anyone explicitly asked for help, but because every individual in that circle wanted the next person to succeed in achieving their shared goals - building something from nothing in this country. My “you can do anything” mindset stems directly from my exposure to this culture, and I am proud to be the owner of my own business in New York - home to the most inspiring community of entrepreneurs in the world. I’ve always believed that together, we can do anything.
