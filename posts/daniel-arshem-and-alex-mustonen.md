## K&M Camera
**Daniel:** So K&M is this camera shop in lower Manhattan that specializes in film. When you walk in it’s pretty clear that this is the kind of place that was probably commonplace in the city 30, 40 years ago. There are just used, primarily film, cameras everywhere. When you walk in the back there are buckets that they’ve thrown all kinds of lenses in. I never know what people do with them - maybe they’re for parts? Then you have your Leica area, your Pentaxes, and, all the way in the back is the super nerd medium format section. I just bought a mint condition Contax G2 there the other day. You could probably find a bunch of the stuff they sell on eBay, but there’s nothing like being able to walk in and test everything out.

## Five Leaves

**Alex:** Five Leaves is a restaurant right by my house in Greenpoint, so I go there quite a bit. It’s nice that it still feels like a comfortable, neighborhood spot even though it draws a fairly large crowd now. I also like that you can get a coffee there pretty early in the morning and get a drink later on. I’ll sit outside and hang out. It just has a good vibe.

## Public School

**Alex:** Max and Dao at Public School are friends and frequent collaborators of ours. They’re one of a few brands that are not only designing in New York, but manufacturing their product here as well. That’s really compelling to us because a lot of our work is made in New York, too. When you work with, say, fabricators or contractors here, you pay a premium for that, but the upside is being able to source materials locally and create this exchange with the community. So, it’s great to see designers in fashion be very deliberate with those choices as well.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

**Alex:** Well, we’re an independent business. If you’ve gone through that, if you live it, you understand the drive required to run your own company. So you have to support (or at least respect) it when other people commit to doing the same thing. We’re all in it together.

**Daniel:** I also think that, especially in creative fields, Independent businesses are where innovation happens - it’s where things move forward.
