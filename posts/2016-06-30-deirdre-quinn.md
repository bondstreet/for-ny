## Lafayette 148 New York

For our customization and speed. By reinventing the business model vertically, we are now able to quickly address our customers’ needs and offer unparalleled service.

## 11 Howard

Another independent business I admire is 11 Howard. Transforming a local neighborhood Holiday Inn into a new luxury hotel in Soho both optimizes real estate and services the changing needs of the local clientele.

## BDDW

BDDW is another terrific company because they are dedicated to craftsmanship, innovation, quality, and design. As a vertical company we value and admire that each piece is created in Tyler Hayes’s studio in Philadelphia, PA.”

## Why is it important to support independent business?

Supporting independent businesses is essential. Not only does it foster innovation and fuel the local entrepreneurial spirit, but it creates a stronger sense of community. Knowing the people behind the products, who live and work in the same community as you do, leads to better, more personalized customer service, and a product selection better tailored to the clientele. It’s a win-win situation for everyone.
