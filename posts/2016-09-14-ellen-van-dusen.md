## Mr Coco
I have lived across the street from Mr Coco for 7 years. It is a cheap fruit and veggies mecca-- every day they have some kind of berry for a dollar, they always have cut watermelon and pineapple and most days they have ripe avocados for a buck. I usually decide what I am going to have for dinner based on what they have in stock. I asked that they start carrying a certain kind of pickle and the next week they had it. I credit my health and well being in NYC to Mr Coco!

## The West
This is another place that I originally was drawn to for convenience sake (my studio is across the street), but it has quickly carved out a little place in my heart as one of my favorite spots. I was new to coffee when I started going there, but now I'm a full fledged caffeine addict and pop by every day. The staff is super friendly and cool and the music is usually great, it has a real '90s vibe. The coffee is great, and when I feel like treating myself I'll get an avocado toast.

## Duo NYC
This is my favorite clothing store in New York! It is run by two of the best people in the world, sisters Wendy and LaRae. They have a great selection of vintage that they source from dealers across the US. I always feel more relaxed after I spend time in there, and I always leave with something.

## Why is it important to support independent business?
It's important to support small business because small business owners are what keeps culture moving forward. Everyone who starts a business has conviction in their specific vision, and sharing that unique insight into the world helps everyone else create new ideas. In bigger businesses every decision has to be approved by a team, which ultimately waters down the original thought to appeal to a wider audience. To me, it is much more rewarding and inspiring to support businesses and people with a specific viewpoint.
