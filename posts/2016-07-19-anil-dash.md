## Sigfrido’s Barber Shop
Sigfrido's is meaningful just for the idea that a small, independent business can persist for almost half a decade even as the world changes dramatically around it. Everything from demographics to politics to transit has evolved since that barbershop opened — there's a bike lane right out front now! — but inside it's still frozen in time, in a good way. On a personal level, my son got his first haircut there, at an old-fashioned barbershop where they were playing Frank Sinatra and will still do an honest-to-god hot shave with a straight razor. I don't even like Sinatra and I was happy about that.

## Pushcart Coffee
Pushcart Coffee appeals to me for almost the opposite reasons. It's been around for a while in the neighborhood, but they're extremely intent on supporting the creative and entrepreneurial community to an almost absurd degree. They're always trying new payment gadgets and electronic tip jars and whatever checkin app or customer loyalty app somebody's made. The drinks are good, the wifi is free, and the space is a great one to work in, but I love that they seem to constantly explore what else they could be doing. And that's not to say they don't have far more substantive ways of helping the community: during Hurricane Sandy, when almost nothing else in the neighborhood was open, they went the extra mile to serve us all — it's hard to overstate just how much that kind of support means.

## Veselka
I guess all of my picks are pretty sentimental — none more so than Veselka is. Veselka was one of the first places I frequented when I moved to NYC almost 20 years ago, and it's been a go-to ever since. I think when I first started going, I'd be coming home from a night out and hit Veselka in the early, predawn hours of the morning. Fast forward to a few years ago and I still found myself hitting Veselka at those hours because my son had just been born and we'd all wake up ridiculously early. I guess some things never change. The idea of a place that can grow alongside you at every stage of your life, remain utterly dependable, and stand as the last bastion of the neighborhood’s rapidly vanishing Ukrainian heritage — that’s as meaningful as it is complex to me.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I try to support independent businesses for a lot of reasons. One is simply that they're more interesting than the alternative — I want the menu at a place I go to in New York City to be determined by somebody who lives and works here, not by corporate headquarters trying to optimize for the cheapest product possible. I also love a strong connection to culture; so many businesses are run by immigrants or the children of immigrants, and their traditions seep into the things they offer for sale. Of course, economically, a support system between consumers and independent businesses is also essential for sustainability. The bigger a company gets, the more likely it is that its relationship with my neighborhood will simply become an extractive one. But these small businesses know they need to preserve something greater than just the bottom line, and they show that by running their companies with some soul and style. That's why I'm happy they're all part of the daily routine for me, and will be for my son as he grows up, as well.
