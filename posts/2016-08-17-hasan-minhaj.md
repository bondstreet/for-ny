## Stadium Goods
A running theme throughout all these stories is gonna be, “when I first moved to New York…”. So, when I first got here, I did exactly what I do whenever I land in any city: I asked people (in this case, my friend Josh Luber, who started StockX) where the best sneaker spot is. To me, a good sneaker shop is a central, cultural hub for a very specific type of person. I’m talking about 80s, 90s babies who are into the cultural forces that shaped my childhood - hip hop, basketball, and sneakers. While something like Champs or Foot Locker is as bland as it is ubiquitous, finding a locally owned sneaker spot and talking to the people who hang out there will tell you a lot about what that city’s into. I’ll always try to stop by Stadium Goods for half an hour whenever I have some time on the weekends.

## Frank’s Chop Shop
Jordan Klepper is like my big brother at The Daily Show. When I first joined, Klepper was like, “hey, welcome to the city,” and I immediately noticed how similarly pompadour-ish and newscaster-y our hairstyles looked. It was like...damn, I’m you in brownface and you’re me in whiteface! So I asked him what’s good - where do you get your hair cut? And he told me to go down to Frank’s Chop Shop - that’s the spot. Klepper lives in Brooklyn now, so he has a place he goes to out there, but at the time, he was always hitting up Chop Shop. A few other dudes cosigned it, as well. 

You gotta realize, I grew up in Davis, California - which is basically strip malls, sadness, and fields. So, during those years, you’d just go to the nearest Supercuts and pray. You’d pray that they wouldn’t fuck it up too badly. It wasn’t until I got my grown man on that I realized there were specific barber shops you could go to and walk out without regret. Prior to that, I’d always graded my haircuts on a bell curve, like, if this manages to look OK in four or five days, that was acceptable. So once I got that TV money I started coming to Frank’s Chop Shop and since then, two guys - Yuk and Danny - have taken care of me. Those guys...any good barber, really...are like therapists - they know what’s going on in your head, what’s on your head, the shape of your head...they really know a lot about what’s happening in and on your dome. The point of this story is, don’t put yourself in the wrong hands when it comes to barber shops - that could fuck your whole life up. It’s very much a Professor X or Magneto situation, you know what I mean?

## Burgers by Honest Chops
My wife is a phenomenal cook. I’m not overhyping her - she’s incredible. Just yesterday, we’re sitting on the couch and she’s like, “hm. I’m kinda hungry. You want some seared salmon and risotto?” That’s the way her mind works, whereas I’m like, Top Ramen or Honey Bunches of Oats with almond milk...and maybe I’ll chop some bananas up into the Honey Bunches of Oats if I’m really trying to treat myself. Meanwhile, she’s already at pan-seared fish. So the relationship she has with people she buys ingredients from is very important to her. The opinion of a great, local butcher is crucial because they really know what’s good. It’s about being close to the source, right? Like, before anything hits the market floor, if you can go directly to the butcher, he or she is hooking you up with the best chops of meat.

So my wife has been going to the Honest Chops guys for a long time, and they opened up a halal butchery. Despite the specificity of that endeavor, their clientele really is everybody - the quality of the meat is so on point that you can’t help but to mess with them. It was really gratifying for me to see these guys open something up for a particular community but be embraced by everybody in the neighborhood. In fact, their ground meat was so good, people would always tell my boy Khalid (who owns Honest Chops) that he should open a burger shop. So that’s what he did. 

When I was a kid, my mom would make like, Desi versions of burgers. And don’t get me wrong, I love McDonald’s burgers, so at the time, I wasn’t trying to have a Desi-fied version of burgers. But now that I’m older, I’ll always catch myself being like, “yo...I miss that!” I didn’t even know what I had! The Honest Chops turkey burger has a spicy, masala-like vibe to it, which reminds me of how my mom used to make her burgers, so I love it. It’s one of my favorite burgers in the city.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I think your decision to support independent businesses ties directly into the level of civic pride you have in your city. It’s about how much you care about maintaining the vibrancy of your city’s cultural tapestry. Independent businesses give cities their shape, texture, color, and taste...often literally. Communities are built around them. I appreciate local businesses because I grew up in a town that was very Anytown, USA. That landscape was completely saturated with Targets, Whole Foods, Starbucks...any big box business you could name. The argument for these massive, corporate enterprises, of course, is “well, we provide a much more scalable solution at a better price.” Ironically, that’s just made it so that I want so support independent businesses more; if I see a local barbershop or market competing with these guys, I’m willing to pay the same amount or even more of a premium to get the feeling and experience you can only find through small businesses.

I’m saying all of this as a touring comedian, so the proof is in the pudding. Some of the most horrific experiences I’ve had on the road are like...I’ll go to certain cities, wake up in my hotel room, go to the local shopping area, and it feels like Groundhog Day. Because it’s the same Chipotle, Borders, Wal-Mart - one after the other. Rinse and repeat. Look, I get that a lot of people feel like, “oh, I like being able to get the same thing everywhere I am. That’s really convenient.” But to me, that feels like the worst kind of dystopian future. I don’t like that at all. So, yeah - it’s a texture, flavor, and shape thing with independent businesses. Whatever city I’m in, I’m looking for those places and, as someone who lives in New York, I hope this city never loses that.
