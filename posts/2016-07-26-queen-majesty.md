## La Newyorkina Tiendita 
This place is very special to me because I'm inspired by the woman who owns it, chef Fany Gerson (who is also a founder and chef of Dough Donuts). In the daytime her team is hand-making special paletas and ice cream in the commercial kitchen and at night she rents it out to my team to make Queen Majesty Hot Sauce. After hurricane Sandy, the kitchen was nearly destroyed but they came back from that and have been thriving! Fany donates to Crea, a charity that helps find employment opportunities for low-income Mexican women and she is just finishing her third cookbook. Yeah!

## Sahadi's 
I've spent many hours in here browsing through products and have made many purchases based purely on the packaging design. In addition to their impeccable assortment of items that you can't find anywhere else, they also have great bulk and spice sections. It's always cool when you can feel the age of the space that you're in - Sahadi's has been around for over 100 years and at this location since the 1940's! The people behind this place are incredibly supportive of local makers and I'm sure that's largely due to their own history in the neighborhood. I have had my hot sauce in there for over 2 years now and I'm extremely grateful for and proud of that.

## Home Of The Brave 
This expertly curated shop belongs to Bethany & Max Vogel, the same owners of the sister store a block away, Wolves Within. I live in South Brooklyn so I don't get to come here as often as I would like, but I am always impressed when I do. As a close friend of Bethany's for almost 15 years, I've had the opportunity to see some  of the process of opening and running your own store. This talented couple makes running two stores (and raising a kid, working on other projects, etc) look much easier than it is and the elegance with which they do it leaves a lasting impression on me. They also support local artists with regular art openings / shows, so check them out when your in the area!

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
As a small business owner myself, I can't help but think of the excitement, stress, jubilation, love, sleeplessness, etc. that must happen on a daily basis for the people behind these operations. The idea that they are taking the time and risk to pursue a living by offering services and goods to the community every day is very admirable to me. Forget ordering things on Amazon, let's support our neighbors!
