## La Newyorkina Tiendita 
This place is very special to me because I'm inspired by the woman who owns it, Chef Fany Gerson (who is also a founder and chef of Dough Donuts). During the day, her team is busy hand-making special paletas and ice cream in their on-site commercial kitchen. At night, she rents it out to my team at Queen Majesty Hot Sauce. After Hurricane Sandy, the kitchen was nearly destroyed, but they came back from that and have been thriving ever since! Fany donates to Crea, a charity that helps find employment opportunities for low-income Mexican women and she is also finishing up her third cookbook. Yeah!

## Sahadi's 
I've spent many hours in Sahadi’s cruising through package designs, a pastime that’s also informed how I’ve purchased more than a few items from the shop. Aside from their impeccable assortment of cool items you can't find anywhere else, they also have an amazing bulk food and spices section. It’s always cool when you can feel the age of a space that you’re in - Sahadi's has been around for over 100 years and at this particular location since the 1940s! The people behind this place are incredibly supportive of local makers and I'm certain that's largely due to their own history in the neighborhood. I have had my hot sauce stocked there for over two years now and I'm extremely grateful for and proud of that.

## Home Of The Brave 
This expertly curated shop belongs to my good friends Bethany and Max Vogel, the same owners of the sister store a block away, Wolves Within. I live in South Brooklyn so I don't get to come here as often as I would like, but I am always impressed when I do. I've known Bethany for almost 15 years now, so, through that relationship, I was fortunate to get a lot of behind-the-scenes looks at the process of opening and running your own store. This talented couple makes running two stores (and raising a kid, working on other projects, etc) look way easier than it is; as the owner of my own business, I can definitely attest to this. A big reason that Home of The Brave has always struck a chord with me is that Bethany and Max just do what they do so well. I always appreciate the simplicity and elegance of that. They also support local artists with regular art openings and shows, so check them out when you’re in the area!

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Our city is like 1000 thread count sheets. However, without small businesses the thread count would drop closer to, let's say, 600. The specificity of this metaphor can be attributed to my youth - I grew up with cheap sheets, I hate cheap sheets, and my wish for everyone is that you all get to experience the luxury of owning nice sheets. Plus, I am a small business owner myself. While I don’t own or operate a brick and mortar location for my company, I can relate a bit to the nonstop mix of: ideas, excitement, stress, jubilation, love, sleeplessness, etc. that must happen on a daily basis for the people behind these operations. The idea that locals - our neighbors - are taking the time and risks to pursue a living by offering services and goods to their community every day is very admirable to me. We have to support that!
