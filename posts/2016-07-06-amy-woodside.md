## Sky Ting Yoga
I work out a lot, so I like to focus on the stretchiness inherent to yoga as opposed to the strength-building side of it. Fortunately, SKY TING’s approach to yoga happens to be nice and stretchy. The studio is run by two lovely women, Krissy and Chloe; they lead a team of teachers who are all exceptionally nice and great at what they do. I’m a big fan of women who run shit. The fact that SKY TING is so close to my apartment - and that the space is beautifully designed - are also nice bonuses. My favorite thing, though, is how they make yoga feel like it’s part of your everyday life as opposed to a separate commitment. Where else can you listen to Biggie and TLC while taking a class? Everything about SKY TING is really simple and fun - it’s a great community to be a part of.

## Happy Bones
Happy Bones is the family biz. My husband Jason has taken the reins with the shop, but it was definitely built with a ton of help from our community and networks. From the design that was done by a great friend of mine, [Lotta](http://www.okreal.co/articles/lotta-nieminen/), to our partners (who are both fellow New Zealanders) - everything was made possible by people we’re close to. All of this started because we couldn’t find great coffee in New York six years ago. That might be hard to believe now, but back then there weren’t a lot of options. Being from New Zealand - where coffee culture is a huge part of our lives - we decided to try and bring that vibe to the city. That’s why we sell flat whites and so on. As far as the design is concerned, all of us wanted to get away from that rustic, artisanal aesthetic that you find all over the place, so we went with a fresh, industrial, and minimalist approach to the shop. Mainly, we care that the team is made up of solid people. You can find someone who’s an incredible barista, but if they suck as a person, what’s the point? You can teach someone how to make good coffee, but you can’t teach a good attitude. We know that we’re the first people our customers might be interacting with on any given day, so we try to help our friends and neighbors get their mornings off to a better start.

## Mast Books
I’ve been going to Mast since I arrived in New York. Now that I live on 2nd and A, it’s my local bookshop, as well. As someone who’s always been a big reader and writer, there’s something special about Mast that’s always drawn me to the store. It’s my low-key escape zone. If I had to put my finger on it, I’d have to say it’s between their unbeatable curation and that it still feels like a remnant of the old New York. They’ll always have a book in there that Patti Smith sneezed on or something so it’s worth a million dollars - really rare stuff that you can’t dig up anywhere else. Because my thing has always been creative writing, I’ll normally make a beeline for their poetry collection. You can almost always find what you’re looking for at Mast, but you’ll more likely discover something you didn’t even know you needed.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Being an independent business owner myself with [OKREAL](http://www.okreal.co/), and being involved in [Happy Bones](http://happybonesnyc.com/), I know how invaluable that support is. You can’t underestimate its effect on a business. If people in your neighborhood are working hard to make something great happen, you choosing to buy a coffee at their shop instead of Starbucks, or taking a class with them instead of at an Equinox - it’s directly helping them achieve their dreams. All of that gets paid back to the community and strengthens it, it’s a reciprocal energy. In my experience, I’ve found that if you support people you will be supported in turn.
