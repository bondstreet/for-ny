## Brooklyn Ball Factory
I always come here to get good coffee - the kind that someone who really knows and loves coffee makes...ok, that's not all - I come here to get coffee AND onigiri, or whatever other assortment of various japanese dishes I might be feeling that day. Brooklyn Ball Factory always puts the most meticulous preparation into the food and drinks they serve, which is complemented perfectly by their cozy space, amazing skylight, and rooftop. The whole operation is tucked unassumingly behind this imposing tin door on the street. I come here to work, to have lunch, or to sit outside on the roof just because. I love a good space that exudes relaxing vibes from its decor, its food, its patrons, and service.

## Syndicated
I love the feeling of 'going to the movies' in a classic theater with the smell of popcorn everywhere; sinking into velvet seating next to strangers who are also here to enjoy the same film - that’s the complete package for me. These days, however, with ticket prices hanging around $20 a screening, going to the theater isn’t as accessible as it should be. Syndicated offers movies both old and new, (from Romero’s original The Living Dead series to this year’s White Girl) for 3 bucks - and you can order a beer and dinner from your seat. The massive bar and restaurant outside of the theater really establishes the sense that you’re in this vintage, art deco space complete with tall ceilings, art-nouveau ornamental lighting, and a full island bar. The details place you in this romanticized experience of feeling like you're at a movie theater in the 70s. This side of Syndicated also makes it a great hangout spot for any occasion - if you’re not there to catch a film, it’s great for drinks and a quick bite, too.

## Brooklyn Boulders Queensbridge  
I spend so much time here with my boyfriend - still working on that finger grip strength and building up those callouses! For the most part, everybody who comes to Brooklyn Boulders is respectful, helpful, and friendly. Everyone is here to challenge themselves and each other in a constructive way - that really sums up climbing culture’s ethos as a whole. While BK Boulders obviously has various walls that allow you to explore everything from bouldering to top-roping, it also offers spaces for you to get some work done, a small gym, classes, and a small sauna as well. These features make it really easy to spend at least few hours whenever you walk through their doors. I also appreciate that BK Boulders has a culture that eliminates any sort of unnecessary alpha-bro competitiveness, allowing you to really focus on yourself, both physically and mentally. Name one person who never - even as a kid - wanted to climb up a bunch of rocks. That's who this place is for, in the most open-minded and judgement-free setting. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
There is something so special about going to a restaurant, cafe, or shop and interacting directly with the owner (or people not so far removed from the owner). Meeting people who are equally passionate about their product and customers make independent businesses vastly more appealing than massive, corporate-owned enterprises where you’re always forced to wonder if the people working there actually even give a shit. In an age when you can purchase services or products without any physical interaction whatsoever, the ability to humanize - to engage beyond the facade of a website or social media is so vital to me...and that’s why indie businesses are so important to every single community.
