## Noah

Noah is one of my favorite brands out right now. What I love most is how clean-cut and classic the designs and colors are - in some ways, what they’re doing reminds me of Ralph Lauren in its prime. It’s rare to come across a brand these days that really understands publishing cadence outside of the seasonal release calendar; Noah stands out to me because of its steady supply of new designs that constantly holds my interest. It’s been great to see more and more people get behind them in a relatively short period of time.

## Kinfolk

Kinfolk, man. These guys really struck a chord with me on so many levels. Getting into prime Williamsburg at just the right time and finding that location really helped them anchor down and catalyze tremendous change.  When I think Kinfolk, I think “cultural hub.” The event space, the music, the energy coupled with the in-house brand and other stuff they carry - it’s just been great to see them grow and flourish. Beyond how savvily and proficiently they execute, they’re great people; they deserve to win. Really excited to see what they cook up in the years to come.

## Pearl’s

Pearl’s - wow - just incredibly dope Trinidadian food. A lot of us native New Yorkers grew up with West Indian food being a staple in the outer boroughs. I used to always eat curried goat with rice and peas up in Baychester, BX when I was younger; it always surprises me how hard it’s become to find authentic West Indian food outside of a few traditional spots I’ve frequented since I was a kid. Thankfully, I stopped by Pearl’s shortly after they opened and it was love at first bake. For those who don’t know, a bake is a Trinidadian sandwich of sorts that consists of fried bread, a seafood or meat, etc. and a whole bunch of trimmings…any of Pearl’s bakes are a must-have if you’re running around Williamsburg. Also, both John and Fallon Seymour always show love and are doing so much on a ton of different fronts.  Definitely check Pearl’s out if you haven’t been by already.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

As more and more businesses get absorbed or pushed out by “big brother” through acquisition, gentrification or automation, we have to realize that it’s independent, small businesses that keep neighborhoods and communities special. Also, in terms of innovation, independent business is where it’s really at. Very few large companies can stay ahead of trends or marketplace dynamics in a way that resonates with consumers, though small businesses that stay on the front lines do so with ease. At the same time, owning a small business is by no means the easier road; quite the contrary. So we support the folks we rock with knowing the connections between us make us all stronger.
