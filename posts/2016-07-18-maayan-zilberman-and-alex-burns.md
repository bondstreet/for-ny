## Hugo & Sons 
M: I've been friends with the owners of Hugo & Sons, Andrea and Rebecca, since art school, where Andrea and I were studio neighbors. Skip ahead 15 years and we find out (through random coincidence) that we'd been living a block away from each other in Park Slope without knowing it. Andrea was planning to open an Italian restaurant right on our corner in a space that had been boarded up for decades. I was so happy to hear that one of my oldest friends would be creating a neighborhood gem for everyone to hang out in, filled with all my favorite Andrea recipes and family memorabilia from Sicily. To contribute to the ambiance, I made a handful of small paintings that grace the walls of the dining room - it makes me very happy to see them there whenever I walk past Hugo & Sons every morning. Our friend Mark, an original NYC sign painter, did all the signage by hand.

## Ample Hills
A: Ample Hills is a place that we happened upon during one of our first walking dates (days or nights where we just walk without a specific plan). I think I had passed by it a couple of times prior but, to be honest, ice cream was never really something I was a fiend for. One trip to Ample Hills changed that forever. While everyone else is busy making rose petal infused bullshit Ample Hills is cranking out the real deal...smooth, creamy, and full of amazing mix-ins. We got so obsessed with Ample Hills that Maayan bought me an ice cream maker and the Ample Hills cookbook for my birthday last year. We've been experimenting with our own flavors - so far, "Easter Sundae" & "MILF Chocolate" have been real crowd pleasers.

## Latino Jewelry
M: When I was little, my grandparents gave me a nameplate necklace in Hebrew from a guy in the market in Jerusalem. I've worn it since - originally, it dangled by my rib cage and now it sits right above my collarbone. I got an updated one a few years ago from the same market in a new font. When I moved to NYC in the 90s I noticed all the girls downtown wearing gold nameplates...I always wanted wanted one to encapsulate this important stage in my life but I didn't know where to go, or if having a THIRD "Maayan" would put it over the edge. Enter Mr. Burns...

A: When I was growing up in New York, one of the ways you stayed fresh was with custom jewelry: name plates, belt buckles, door knockers, gold fronts. Canal St was the Mecca for custom gold jewelry and Latino Jewelers is a Canal St. gold spot that operates in the classic New York tradition. Cases and cases of chains, rings, earrings - whatever you want, they can do it. I wanted to get something for Maayan that would evoke the classic 90's era that I know she loves and let everyone know who she was with...hence the "I'm with Burns" nameplate in the classic baseball script. These days, there are fewer and fewer stores like Latino Jewelers on Canal (or anywhere for that matter), but there's really no substitute for the original Canal St. experience. If you go by Latino, ask for Tommy and tell'em Burns sent ya. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
M: My favorite thing to do in this city is to walk around and explore small shops and talk to business owners. What makes NYC so special is how you can come here with a particular talent, set up shop, and make a living in such close proximity to others who share your passion. Over the last few years, as I've taken walks through my favorite neighborhoods, I've noticed fewer and fewer of these businesses and more and more banks and pharmacies moving in to take their place. While I understand that times change, I can't stress enough how important it is for us to show our fellow independent businesses support - keeping them here is keeping the NYC spirit we know and love alive. 

A: As someone who grew up in New York, I've seen a tremendous amount of change occur over the last 30 years. New York will always be an amazing, vibrant city and people from all over the world will always be drawn here. I do think, however, that in some ways New York has become a victim of its own success, particularly when it comes to the cost of doing business and the cost of living. More than ever, itâ€™s becoming impossibly difficult for small business owners to really stand a chance. 

It's a cliche at this point, but every time a local business closes down, I wonder what national chain will move into that space. The real tragedy is the loss of culture; endangering small businesses homogenizes the culture of New York City. When people around the world allow big corporations to decide on and standardize products available to them, visiting other places becomes irrelevant. Small businesses represent the creative consciousness - they contribute tremendously to the unique identities of communities everywhere.
