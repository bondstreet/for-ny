## The Football Cafe

The Football Cafe was our first stop as we had to get smoothies (they also have amazing coffee) to start the day. I feel like I'm somewhere special whenever I walk in there. The cafe is a partnership, and I love that it supports the community of (futbol) league players (and enthusiasts) in a tiny, but really beautiful cafe, looking out on the soccer fields across Forsyth. Their menu of smoothies is really original, and I appreciate that each takes time to make - they have like 10 things in every drink including several house-made ingredients.

## CW Pencil Enterprises

Literally next door to the Football Cafe is one of the nicest little surprises in the whole city- CW Pencil Enterprises. This is a place for those who fan out over all things OG - as in original gangster - or more aptly, the version of something that has almost been rendered obsolete, like this glorious writing utensil. I truly have a deep love for such artifacts and, believe it or not, I still draw all of my designs in pencil. So a store full of pencils and erasers - like you cannot even imagine how many varieties of pencils could be available at your fingertips - it's just too amazing.

## The Sill

Next we wandered straight into my urban oasis - The Sill. I actually met The Sillâ€™s owner, Eliza, after her now-husband proposed to her with one of my rings. I was immediately impressed with her concept, branding, and the business model (which at the time was predominantly focused online). When she opened her brick-and-mortar shop in the LES, I was over the moon. The plant selection is just beautiful and the subtly Sill-branded pots are really special. They offer the kind of gifts that you want to give as well as receive. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

All of the places we visited are a just short walk from each other and from my business. I feel like there is a strong feeling of solidarity that emerges from that, which is something quite unique to the New York small business experience. And the best thing is that there are so many more we could have seen!
