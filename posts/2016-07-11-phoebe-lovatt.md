## Dimes
I came across DIMES on Instagram when I was still living in LA. I could tell it was the kind of place I'd love, and it is: the food, wine, decor, and vibes...everything is just right. When I came to New York a couple of months after launching The WW Club in LA, I contacted Sabrina and Alissa via a mutual friend to ask if they'd speak on my first panel event in NYC. They agreed straightaway, even though we'd never met. Sabrina was really sick that day and she still turned up! That's just the kind of women they are.

## Sky Ting Yoga
There are a lot of yoga studios in New York, but Chloe and Krissy really nailed it with Sky Ting. Again, every aspect of the space and brand is on point, from the playlists to the Instagram feed (hilarious!) to the presence of Tommy, their delightful studio manager. It's a lesson in how to run a really slick operation but do so with a sense of grace and humor - the whole vibe is just fun. And you can't beat the name.

## Frankie
Frankie is a relatively recent discovery for me, but I can already tell I'll spend a lot of time - and money! - in there. Not only is the range of womenswear they carry super-chic, but it comes at a range of price points so it's easy to find something you love and can actually afford. It's run by a woman (do you sense a theme emerging here?) named Gaelle Drevet who also founded Pixie Market. We're yet to meet, but she clearly this woman is highly savvy and super-stylish. Killer combo.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I've been lucky to live in a few cities and to visit quite a few more, and one thing that really freaks me out is how homogenous they can feel. By supporting independent business, I feel like I'm doing my bit to combat the more soulless aspects of commercialism and globalization. New York is also the place that I formed my own independent business, The WW Club. Through my own experiences and by sharing those of other women doing the same thing, I've learnt that running a business is no joke! Especially in a city as competitive and expensive as New York. I'm more motivated than ever to provide a community and a platform for women on their grind - here, and everywhere.
