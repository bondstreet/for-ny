## Veggies
Veggies (on Nostrand) is the place we go to have a green juice or small snack - knowing that we're supporting black-owned, community-based businesses is important to us. They're always friendly and all of the ingredients that they use are fresh and delicious. The Caribbean and Rasta communities of Brooklyn have been focused on eating healthy, fresh and often organic food long before it became a more mainstream trend. Focusing on full body nutrition, living a balanced life and eating foods that are good for the planet as well as our bodies is not a lifestyle just belonging to those more recently moving into the neighborhood.

## Sacred Yoga Studios
Sacred Yoga Studios (on Clifton Place) is a special place where we go to detox, cleanse our bodies and minds, and re-charge. There are real relationships between all of us - teachers and learners - and the teachers at Sacred are healers, educators, and artists building community beyond the studio. It's important to us that our physical and spiritual self care is within the context of collective care and strengthening community. There's also an emphasis on awesome music, which is crucial!

## BedVyne
BedVyne (on Tompkins) has a wine shop, supports local CSA deliveries, a brewery, and just opened a cocktail bar. They often have parties that our friends DJ at so we can go pick up wine for dinner and then also stop by for a cocktail and a boogie. It's a relaxed and friendly place owned by people who have deep roots here. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses? 
We chose all of these places because they each contribute to our overall wellness and balance while we live and operate a food service company in Brooklyn. Keeping money in the hands of people who are plugged into the community's needs and nurturing a local economy is a concrete way of practicing our principles. Both of us love Brooklyn so deeply, despite neither of us being from here originally. We are often concerned by transplantsâ€™ facilitating the erasing and displacement of the very cultures, communities, and businesses that have made Brooklyn the vibrant, unique, inspiring place it is. We do our best to support businesses run by people who are from and of this borough so that we are part of the solution - not the problem - as much as possible. 

Nurturing the culture and community of the space we're in ties into the way that we operate Harvest & Revel - we cook food shaped by the season, the moment, the people and events around us. By conducting ourselves in this way, we hope to always give respect and credit where it's due!
