## Sweet Chick
Let me preface this by noting that I am a waffle connoisseur. Sweet Chick has unequivocally fulfilled all of my waffle needs. They make light, crispy, airy waffles - these are people who obviously know how to fold their egg whites. A great waffle is very crispy on the outside but a little soft at the core. That’s ideal. You don’t want it to be too doughy. A place that uses real maple syrup also shows me that they care about going the extra mile - it’s like great sushi - the fish has to be as good as the rice, and vice versa. It’s about the combination effect.

When we lost Max Fish and Sweet Chick took the space on Ludlow, I was skeptical at first, but they’ve proven to be a great addition to the neighborhood. They understand and enhance the community around them - you can see how they give back and that they’re not just in it for the money. The chicken is great, as well.

## Turntable Lab
Turntable Lab has been a part of the community for a long time now, and they’ve always stood on the fact that they have a great selection of hardware and software (including music). They’ve always kind of been in a niche spot, both in regards to their audience and where they sit in the neighborhood, but vinyl is bigger than ever and the guys have really capitalized on that momentum. The curation at Turntable Lab is really what it’s all about - I DJ so I’ll rent a lot of stuff from TTL...often, they’ll have stuff that no one else has. They’re a great resource for beginners and audiophiles alike; everyone who works there knows more than you do about music, but none of them will be condescending or treat you like shit. They talk you through everything, let you try stuff out, and price things fairly for you. You could buy stuff at Guitar Center or wherever, but I support Turntable Lab because they’ve always kept their feet in (and given back to) the East Village.

## Dudley’s
Dudley’s is the only place that makes a flat white the way I like it. I have an Aussie girlfriend who’s made me a connoisseur of Australian coffee techniques. The Australian coffee game is on point. The flat white at Dudley’s always wakes me up - I can’t say that about most other flat whites I’ve had in the city. The food is also great here; Dudley’s took over a space that was formerly occupied by a pretty snobby restaurant, and the crew has turned it into a great, accessible place to just hang out at. The owners are really good guys, you’ll always see a friendly face here, and for the ladies there’s always cute Aussie guys working here. Strong coffee, strong drinks, and strong food, 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
New York has always been the backdrop to a lot of my videos. For “Jump Around” by House of Pain, we were at the Old Town Tavern. Little Italy always offered so much as a background - now that it’s shrunken and most of it is called Nolita, we’ve lost the postcard-like mystique the city had throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Real estate developers who don’t care about the heritage of the city keep making buildings that look like structures anywhere else. The bodegas we used to shoot at are gone. So, as a director, I’ll say that, in losing local businesses, we’ve lost a lot of the spirit and textures and locations that made us want to stay and work in New York.       

As someone who came up here, I’ve watched so many shit corporations take over and gentrify neighborhoods throughout the city. I wanted to take you to so many places that were important to me while I was growing up, but a lot of them are gone. I would have taken you to 2nd Avenue Deli, but that’s like a Chase Bank now...half of the other spots are condos. Small businesses are why people come to New York - they give the city (and every neighborhood in it) a distinct personality and voice. They reflect the people who’ve all gathered here to make New York their home. If we lose small businesses in New York, it’ll start looking like every other cookie cutter, strip mall town in America. We have to support small businesses to keep New York feeling like the place people want to visit.
