## Smooch
Smooch is right up the block from my house, so I like it for obvious reasons. The owner is this hilarious character from Australia. When wifey and I started dating back in ‘04 we started frequenting Smooch a lot - at that time, this block was considered off the beaten path, so there were way fewer people who’d be in there. It kind of stayed slow like that for two or three years, to the point where we were worried that they’d have to shut down. As Fort Greene has gradually come to embody the apex of gentrification in Brooklyn, Smooch has gotten more and more packed. I’m not disenchanted about people finding out about the spot, though - it’s great that Smooch can draw a crowd. There’s a strong community around it - everyone who’s a regular knows each other. The fact that it’s still kicking after all this time is a testament to them doing things the right way. Plus, I don’t use sweeteners besides maple syrup, so they let me keep a private stash of it on deck at the facilities.

## Ina
Ina started out as a women’s high fashion consignment store way back in the day. I actually met the manager at the time, Khadejia, because I used to work for Russell Karablin (aka SSUR) in ‘99, ‘00 when they were dating. Once Ina expanded next door and started doing men’s consignment as well, I’d pop my head in more and more. They quickly became the place I’d go if I was looking for a formal piece of clothing - a suit jacket or something like that. Ina opened not long after Supreme did...I wanna go out on a limb and say they’ve been around since the mid-late ‘90s. So, again, the longevity is a real testament to how much of an asset they’ve been for Soho and the community. I’ve seen a lot of businesses (both big and small) on Prince come and go since the skate days - Ina could be the longest-standing one on the block. While it’s on the low and kind of hidden in plain sight, there’s jewels at Ina - if you want to buy something special, hit them up.

## Lovely Day
For whatever reason, the staff - both men and women alike - are all good looking here. More importantly, the food is crazy. The owner of Lovely Day, Kazusa, was dating a guy I knew who worked for Corpus Denim. I was working at Nom de Guerre at the time, right before I went to the Academy, and we used to carry Corpus at the store. So that’s how I met Kazusa and started coming to Lovely Day. While a lot of the things I just mentioned have either changed up or disappeared, I’ve been a patron at Lovely Day ever since. Also, a Japanese woman making Thai food with Mexican cooks - that’s some true New York shit right there. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Simply put, supporting small businesses keep local, non-corporate, family-owned infrastructures stable. That support allows these systems to remain independent and continue to serve the communities they’re in. This isn’t just true of New York, this is something that is universally applicable to any town or city in the country. Your support of small businesses keep them healthy, which in turn allows communities to remain healthy, as well.
