## BollyX Instructors 
Each BollyX fitness instructor is a small business of their own. By marketing and running their own classes, they are entrepreneurs who work hard to motivate and inspire people to live active, healthy and positive lives.

## New York Health & Racquet Club 
As a staff member of the New York Health & Racquet Club, I am proud to be among a team of people who provide members across NYC with fitness classes. As a tight knit community, the NYHRC has a strong culture of warm service towards the members and staff.

## Booya Fitness
I love seeing the innovation currently happening with startups expanding the reach of fitness to more homes. Booya Fitness is an awesome digital fitness video platform I have worked with that streams workouts (including barre, pilates, dance and high intensity cardio training) from the best fitness instructors and studios out there.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I believe it's important to support independent businesses because it not only empowers individuals to work for their dreams, but the impact of innovation that comes from small businesses drives progress in our economy. Much of my company's success can be attributed to another small business that I continue to work with today - Condensed.io. They are a design and web development agency that very much works lockstep with my team to drive our product offering and brand awareness. Today, we very much consider them as core to our family. Independent businesses are able to drive value in their abilities to be nimble, results driven, and innovative.
