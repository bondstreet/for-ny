## T-Shirt Express

Before Gin Lane, I had (and still have) a company called LOLA with a bunch of childhood friends. It was just about getting creative work out through a t-shirt brand - we spent hours and hours in print spots across the whole state. Naturally, I feel pretty comfortable in t-shirt shops...amongst them, T-Shirt Express is just super cutty and they don’t give a fuck. When I go in and ask her how much something is she’ll look up at the ceiling, do the math in her head, and give me a quote. Nothing they do is perfect, but that actually makes everything better - it’s nice to have something with tactile, tangible imperfections in the digital age. It’s almost like a tattoo; proof that something was done by hand.

## Leadbelly

Leadbelly is right around the corner from our office. We’re helping the Fat Radish and Leadbelly guys with a really cool project they’re working on. But before I really knew them, I’d walk by Leadbelly basically every day and look at all the illustrations they had on the wall out front. It was always crazy to me that no one would tag them up or deface them...maybe people respect them because the drawings look like a really talented twelve year old made them.

## Dah Shop

I love skateboarding and riding my bike. It’s just dope that literally on this one island at the end of the block we have what is basically the best skate shop in the city, Labor, and the best bike store, which is Dah Shop. I remember watching this video on Animal of this crazy styled out guy in all white take out a Citi Bike and just freestyle rip on it. Then, when I came down here for the first time this dude was posted out front and it turned out to be his shop. I just love how there are always people having good conversations about bikes in there and it gives kids in the community a good place to chill.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

You can gauge the health of any city and state by the success of their small businesses. They make neighborhoods better, owners take care of their employees more closely, and because they’re so community facing there’s a greater emphasis on doing the right thing. Independent businesses are the American dream.
