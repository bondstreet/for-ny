## Takahachi Bakery
E: Eat one of their matcha crepes, and tell us you don’t have fantastic feelings about this place. When we moved into our office in the Financial District in 2012, we loved our big windows and proximity to so many train lines, but the neighborhood was a little lacking in terms of good coffee shops and meeting spots. Discovering Takahachi was a big, fat win: It’s spacious enough that you can always get a table, and the Tokyo-born chef, Naoko Mabushi, graduated from the French Culinary Institute and worked at Bouley for years, so you can trust that the things lurking in the pastry cases are as delicious as they look.

## Leather Spa
C: I’ve been bringing my shoes here to be repaired for as long as I’ve had nice shoes, and before that, I would tag along with my mom when she dropped off hers. They used to just have one kind of run-down location in Midtown, and they were called Shoe Service Plus—back then you would never have been able to tell them from the next guy unless you looked at the shipping labels on the bags of repairs they were sending out—Vogue, Chanel, Gucci, etc. They are the go-to for the fashion industry, and with good reason: They will take a pair of beat-up heels or a well-loved purse and return it to you looking better than brand new. They also do incredible dye jobs on all sorts of materials. It’s just downright magic. And now they have the fancy name, sleek-branding, and a downtown location to boot—along with a whole lot of the same employees that were there back when I was tagging along with my mom.

## Tenoverten
E: I kind of hated the experience of getting a mani-pedi until Tenoverten came into the world. Nadine Abramcyk and Adair Ilyinsky turned the nail salon into something considered, well-designed, and genuinely relaxing. You should have seen the joy on my face (and in my heart) when I learned that they were opening a location a block away from Of a Kind HQ—I’m a regular now, and I’m looking for an excuse to book the private space in back for an HBIC hang.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
C: Most independent businesses are run by people - not by boards, not by stockholders, not by algorithms. And so you get a different kind of care and quality in their product because their work is a reflection of themselves. Instead of focusing on the next market they’re expanding into or the next round of funding they’re raising, they’re focusing on the details and being the best they can be.
