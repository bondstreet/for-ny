## JHU Comic Books

I’m kind of a backpack rapper when it comes to comics… my tastes skew pretty ’90s, I like that I can roll up and find weird back issues along with the new stuff and Batman figures. Forbidden Planet is another favorite but why should all the fun stay below 14th street? JHU also has a great ‘Mazing Man sketch by the checkout counter that scratches my obscure DC nerd itch hard.

## J&L Game

Stumbled upon this vintage game mecca walking home from Bryant Park. It’s sooo sweet. My section of choice is the PS1 and 2 stacks, though I’m more a window shopper than anything. I try not to hoard at home anymore so browsing has become my methadone.

## Good Records NYC

Not to be confused with Kanye’s label! A friend opened this spot a few years ago (fun fact: I made the logo!), it’s still one of the East Viillage’s hidden gems and my go-to spot to buy and sell used records. From the dollar bins to the wall trophies, it’s perfectly curated and all heat.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I love that everyone in NYC has a hidden neighborhood outpost and secret spot in the cut. No two people will pick the same favorites, but I guarantee you they’re all independent business. It’s where personalization is born. Rents are only gonna get higher —and I’m pretty sure an Amazon drone is watching me RIGHT NOW — so let’s enjoy and support these one-of-a-kind flavors while we have ‘em.
