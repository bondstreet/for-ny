## Sincerely, Tommy
Sincerely, Tommy is one of the first shops I discovered in Bed Stuy. It’s decidedly a women’s boutique, but being in touch with my feminine side [laughs] allows me to find some compelling stuff whenever I stop by. 

The offerings range from women’s clothing, art books and ephemera, and a very well curated selection of objects - vases, small sculptures, glasses, and jewelry. Kai (Avent De Leon) does a great job of finding affordable items from up-and-coming artists and designers interspersed with a few grails from the bigger names.

While the shop itself is one of the best in the game, the main reason I’m here on the regular is the coffee bar. Dan (Solomito) runs this part of the operation - he is an amazing guy and we’ve quickly become good friends. I enjoy getting a coffee or tea and sitting at the bar for a catch-up. And those pastries? Insane. Strongly recommend the chamomile tea with an apple turnover.

## Spoonbill & Sugartown Booksellers
I recently discovered Spoonbill thanks to my friends Justin Hunt Sloane and Rachel Day. Not much to say about this place except that they really know what they have. Book shops are a dime a dozen throughout Brooklyn in my opinion, but Spoonbill has the rarities. Not just expensive ones, but the meaningful ones - their pricing is actually extremely fair. You won’t find basic Barnes and Noble, mass-produced art books here. Also, anyone who has an original silkscreened Wallace Berman exhibition poster up on their walls gets bonus points in my book. 

My favorite Spoonbill purchase is definitely Thinking of You, a seminal volume documenting the work of Barbara Kruger that was published by MOCA Los Angeles in the early 90s. I’ve never seen this book at any other shop; it’s filled with works and texts that I had no idea existed. My 2nd favorite purchase is what I bought today [laughs] - it’s that crazy German book documenting tubular steel chairs we looked at.

## House of Small Wonder
Not much to say about Small Wonder except that Japanese business owners do everything right. This is the best place for a relaxing coffee or tea with someone special. Not only is there an enormous tree growing right through the middle of the space, the entire ceiling is a greenhouse roof, so the mood inside changes with the weather and light. Hard to say if I prefer sunny days or gloomy days at Small Wonder - they both work so well.

I’d definitely recommend getting the Japanese Hamburg Steak, which is an organic ground beef patty with no bun, melted gruyere cheese on top, cooked to absolute perfection and served with a hardboiled egg. If you’re feeling experimental try the First Impression, a very weird combination of Calpico and beer that surprisingly works really well.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Independent businesses are the core cultural influence and identifiers of any city. They can literally come to define the neighborhoods they’re based in. It’s all about the community these businesses attract and cultivate. 

Often times (almost inevitably), big box businesses with infinite resources will swoop in and take what independent business owners have built up over years, even decades. To the untrained eye, these stores will often have more competitive prices and maybe even be more convenient - but don’t fool yourself. Just remember the hard work and passion that goes into building something from the ground up.

It’s important to realize that by supporting the hard work of entrepreneurs, you support their dreams, as well. How can you not appreciate their passion for delivering you a piece of their imaginations, their heart, and courage?

Lastly, there’s a lot to be said about relationships. I always build a relationship with my favorite local spots. I believe that’s one of the best (and most defining) traits of living in New York - walking into your cafe, high fives all around. Pure positive energy. Walking into your bodega at 3AM - the sandwich guy knows your name and knows your order without you having to say anything. You can feel these people becoming an intrinsic part of your life over time.

That feeling is community. And no matter how hard these big box brands try to plant themselves in a city and siphon from it, they just can’t replicate that. Those values can only come from someone who puts their last dollar into growing a passion into a lifestyle - a reality. It’s handmade, hand-picked, considered carefully, and built with love. Products, objects, experiences - these things have stories, and it takes someone who’s incomparably passionate about them to effectively share those stories with you.
