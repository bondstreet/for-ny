## Scosha

Scosha’s store is beautifully curated with both her own jewelry, inspired by her travels and made by hand in Brooklyn, and a collection of other pieces that make you want to spend some time touching everything.

## Sweet William

Sweet William is my favorite kids’ store, hands-down. It’s so well-curated, with lots of European and Japanese lines that you can’t find anywhere else. It’s my go-to for new baby gifts, and party dresses for my daughter.

## Diner

This is always a controversial statement, but I think Diner has the best burger in New York City. What more is there to say than that?

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

There are so many reasons to support independent businesses. They allow people to make choices. They allow people to work towards realizing their own dreams rather than someone else’s. At their base, they really allow people to set the course of their own lives. But I think one of the most important things about small businesses is that they foster the diversity of thought and taste that makes each city interesting and unique. Without independent businesses, everywhere would be exactly the same, and that would be so boring.
