Dah Shop
My first spot is definitely Dah Shop down on Division, owned by my boy Tyrone who was a local New York City pro I followed while I was growing up. You might have seen him in the video where he’s riding around on a Citi Bike. They’ve supported me since day one, so I’m always grateful to be able to support him, as well. Obviously everyone at Dah Shop understands BMX so we’ve become really good friends. I love that spot. I’ve been going by for about eight years now, ever since they opened. They really fuel the BMX scene down here, especially because they’re so close to the skate park. If you have a part that breaks, you can walk over pretty quickly and chill with everyone while they fix it for you. Dah Shop is the central hub for anyone who rides downtown - it keeps the scene alive.

Chalk Point Kitchen
The second spot I’d pick is Chalk Point at 528 Broome. I support Chalk Point because my good friend Matt Levine owns it. Matt’s been deep in the game for a long, long time - we actually met through my homie Ryan Sheckler and since then, he’s supported what I do and I’ve supported what he does. It’s always a good feeling to be able to support my friends in their endeavors. Chalk Point specializes in organic food - every time you go there for dinner, you know everything’s sourced from local farms and businesses in the area. I love everything on the menu. Oh, also, they run this incredible bar downstairs called The Handy Bar. It’s a super low-key, classic New York City spot. I’m chilling there and getting a drink whenever I can. 

Bill’s Bike Shop
Bill’s Bike Shop is on Roosevelt out in Queens. Before I went pro, I used to go there all the time to get my bike fixed. Those guys have always been super supportive of my pursuit of being a professional BMX rider. The owner, Mark, is one of the people who really fueled my ambition to do what I do today. So I always gotta support him, as well. Bill’s is a general bike shop, but they really get BMX. 

Man, when I was coming up, the guys at the bike shop in my neighborhood in Queens were just assholes, so I’d always travel to Bill’s because they were nice and they understood the culture. Other BMX riders would always be there so it was an added bonus to be able to socialize with all of them and be amongst that NYC BMX community. 

Why is it important to support independent businesses?
It’s extremely important to support independent businesses - they’re the ones that are actually of, and not just in, a community. That means they’re providing opportunity to people in a neighborhood and the interactions you have with them are more personal and intimate.

My foundation and support system before I went pro was all local businesses. Them fueling me and me supporting them right back - that mutual relationship was essential to getting me where I’m at today.
