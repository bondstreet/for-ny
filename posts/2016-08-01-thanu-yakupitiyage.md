## Ode to Babel
Ode to Babel is a bar and cafe owned by two black sisters, Myriam and Marva Babel, who grew up in Bed Stuy. You can find it just off Washington Ave on Dean St. One of the sisters is an interior decorator and the space is just gorgeous and homey - everything from the couches to the  beautiful African prints to the built-in dj booth are all very considered. I really enjoy the concept and warm atmosphere at Ode to Babel. Recently, my DJ crew, Dutty Artz, held a chill talk and music event there and it was just good vibes all around. On top of all that, the cocktails are delicious. This is a must-support business run by local community members of color.

## Marché 
Marché is a dope, affordable boutique right on Bedford Ave and Park Pl - they sell an assortment of vintage clothing, home goods, and other knick knacks. It's a spin-off business connected to the cafe and restaurant Rue Dix (which is right next door to the shop) - both are owned by Senegalese immigrants. I appreciate the style of the store- it's a great place to pick up quick, thoughtful gifts for people and it's close to my home.

## Taqueria Milear 
Taqueria Milear is, hands down, the best Mexican place in Crown Heights. It's a small, very spare hole in the wall with three tables and an order counter, owned by a Mexican immigrant family that has lived in the area for a long time. The whole family works there and the kids help out, which makes Milear feel extra neighborhood-y. The tacos al pastor are amazing, as are the sopes. This is my go-to when I come home from work and don't feel like cooking. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Independent/small businesses are such important parts of neighborhoods and communities - they have the flexibility to be much more creative and lively than corporate establishments are and can foster much more personal connections with their customers. I'm talking about bodegas, hair salons, hole-in-the-walls shops and restaurants, as well as bars, cafes, and clothing stores. I do a lot of work with immigrant communities and communities of color, and the independent business is a real lifeline for economic growth in these communities. By supporting long-standing businesses as well as new businesses owned by people of color and immigrants who have lived in New York for generations, you help send a message of resistance against gentrifying and corporatizing the city.
