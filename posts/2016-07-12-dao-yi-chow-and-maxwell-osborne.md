## Steinlauf and Stoller
D: Spot one is definitely Steinlauf and Stoller, right here by Public School HQ in the heart of the Garment District. 39th between 7th and 8th. This place is a true, old school mom and pop operation - they sell all kinds of shoulder pads, linings, and other pieces or components that you need for tailored construction. It’s hard to find that kind of - and, honestly, that level of - specialization in the city anymore. There’s also this lovely woman named Nancy who works there... 

M: She does everything for us. Full garments, really anything. Since day one.

D: From punched rivets to covered buttons. You name it. Speaking of which, she knows everyone by name except for mine because she can’t pronounce it. But yeah, Steinlauf is cool - it’s an OG garment district hideout. We found out about it years ago just because we were running around trying to figure production out here in the neighborhood.

M: We still see her to this day whenever we walk by. She’s the sweetest lady ever.

## Los Tacos
M: Spot two is definitely Los Tacos. That’s pretty much our hands-down favorite place to get tacos here in the city. Anytime we have meetings at Milk or in the area around Chelsea Market, we always make sure to squeeze in 15 minutes to get a Los Tacos taco. The trick is to ask them for the special menu - not too many people know about it, but go to that special menu. 

We met one of the owners because we’ve been such frequent customers there from the beginning. Back then, the guys who own the spot used to be behind the counter more often. One of them had read about what we were doing online or something and said what’s up when he saw us stop by. The last time we spoke he asked us to design a wedding suit for him but the timing didn’t work out. We have to do something together soon. Los Tacos is our spot.

## Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli
D: Saigon Vietnamese is spot three. You can’t go wrong here. It’s a family-owned joint with the simplest menu of all time. Banh Mi. Pork or chicken, spicy or regular. That’s it. I take chicken, spicy, no cilantro. 

M: I do pork, spicy, no cilantro. 

D: We’ve been going there since 2008 when we first launched Public School. Our office at the time was down on Grand and Crosby, so when we saw that long-ass line coming out of Saigon, we just stopped there and ended up becoming regulars for the whole time we were based in the neighborhood. The bread is perfectly crunchy - maybe too perfectly crunchy - if you eat a lot of it there’s a high probability that you’re going to cut the roof of your mouth. It’s still the perfect meal in a sandwich, though.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
D: Because that’s where the flavor’s at. Independent businesses are started by the kind of people who want to do things differently from the norm. They bring a unique point of view that’s a little sharper because it doesn’t have to be mass or commercial. In other words, independent business owners are the ones who really set trends, regardless of the industry they’re in. As independent owners ourselves, we identify with those values - they’re standards that we try to hold Public School to. It’s admirable when you’re willing to struggle for the love of what you’re doing...when your professional pursuit isn’t driven by the need to generate more and more money, but to provide a service, craft, or product that has a character all of its own. 

M: Perfect.
