## Davey’s Ice Cream
Davey’s is run by a guy named David Yu who was working in graphic design - a completely different industry - and decided one day that, “you know what? I’m going to put all my chips on ice cream.” I really respect and appreciate that kind of move - jumping into a totally new space and applying what he’d learned over the years to make his approach to the category unique. Even more impressive is that he actually made it all work. That’s no easy thing in a city like New York, where restaurants regularly turn over a year, a year and a half in. A lot of people would (and do) say it’s crazy to try something in F&B against odds like that. Davey’s still here, three years later, turning away business, and opening up a second location in Williamsburg. That’s incredible to me.

I’m a big fattie and it’s no secret how much I love ice cream. Today, we tried the speculoos chocolate chip and Thai ice tea. A lot of establishments tend to have a gimmick, but at Davey’s it’s all about the flavor and product. That’s it.

## Turntable Lab
Turntable Lab is a New York staple - I was actually their first employee back in 2000! TTL actually started in an apartment on 12th street between 1st and 2nd Ave; that original location is where I bought my very first mixer. Three guys who are my age came up with the idea - Peter, Anthony, and Jasper - they were like, “yo, let’s start a company and call it Turntable Lab,” and thus, Turntable Lab 001 was born. They went through another location a few years later and are now at this storefront. If you look at the sign it says Turntable Lab 003, signifying that it is, indeed, the third location for TTL. Man. It seems like yesterday they were just getting off the ground - sixteen years later they’re seniors in this thing. I don’t know how the hell that happened!

TTL was always very specific in its curation - its core audience is comprised of audiophiles, vinyl collectors, and music heads. The selection of equipment and records here is peerlessly handpicked - you’re never going to find anything cheap or gimmicky. It’s strictly the best of the best. The staff are also some of the nicest people you’ll meet at a record store - no snobs like John Cusack in High Fidelity. If you come up to someone and ask them, “hey, what mixer should I get? I’m just starting out,” no one’s going to go “what the hell’s wrong with you?” They’ll help you out - it’s a very safe space! 

Oh, it also has to be said that Turntable Lab’s website is great. In the beginning, all of the stuff you could buy through their site was all geared towards the customer with a real turntablist mentality - battle records and so on. But as they’ve adapted, they’ve started to sell things like re-presses of The Pixies’ LPs, clothes, books, and equipment for all skill levels and kinds of DJs. So it’s a testament to the guys that they were able to recognize the need to diversify their offering if they wanted to grow their business and audience. 16 years as a storefront - my God. I mean, Fat Beats closed. Tower Records closed. You gotta respect the Lab, man.

## Stadium Goods
I’m partial to these guys because I’ve known the homies who started it for a long, long time. Especially JDM and Yu-Ming (who I actually met my manager, Sky, through)! As you can see, they went all out with the store - it’s massive and very thought out. I’m glad to see them doing so well despite being new to the scene. You always have Complex filming in here, you have half the NFL in here, you have Cam’ron in here talking about his Fleeboks - Stadium Goods is on. 

Like Turntable Lab, it’s all about the level of service you get here. The staff are all excellent - none of them are going to shit on you for not knowing what you’re talking about. They’ll take the time to help you browse through their insane collection and figure everything out - it’s no surprise that people end up dropping $21,000 (this happened the other day)...that just speaks to the quality of the experience. If you’re a sneakerhead, or even casually interested in sneakers, this is the place to be.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
If I step back and think about it, it always amazes me that by supporting independent businesses like Turntable Lab and Stadium Goods, I get the opportunity to support my friends. When I DJ for a big company, does that actually help my buddy who works there? Maybe a little bit, but probably not so much in the long run. However, if I do the same thing for SG or TTL, I can actually see how it helps their bottom line. So by contributing the tiny amount I can to their growth, I get to share in the sense of pride that comes with these businesses’ ongoing success. It’s way more than dollars spent when you support an independent business. You’re helping real people - who you may know personally - do what they do better.
