## La Villa Pizza (Avenue U location)
I’m a firm believer in having meetings where the food is good. I’m happy to meet people wherever, but you gotta know that the food is good. So...Villa is a hike for a lot of people in the city, but 9 times out of 10, when I’ve had people come out for the meeting here? The deal gets done a little easier. Whatever we’re meeting about tends to go the right way. And then the same people who give me shit about coming out this far end up asking me to link up at Villa next time they see me. 

Villa is dope to me because, one - food-wise, everything is good. Everything I’ve ever had at Villa is good. Two - if you go to Villa two times, by the third time they know who you are. Three - there’s a super neighborhood feel there. You know what I’m saying? It’s not like you’re going to a restaurant; you’re getting restaurant food in a restaurant setting, but it’s almost like you went to your homie’s place for a meal. For instance - just now, we struck up a conversation with two random dudes about who’s the best pitcher, right? Those guys weren’t like, oh we’re not gonna talk to these dudes cuz I’ve never seen them before, they go, “oh they’re at the spot? Not with that jersey!” - and like that, we’re in the middle of a heated debate about who’s the best pitcher. It feels like you know everyone when you’re at Villa. When you can find yourself in a place like that, you always end up wanting to go back. Especially because the food is good. 

I used to eat the entrees, but one day, the guy I first met who works there was like, “yo, try this” - it was the pizza - and then I was like, aw damn. Now I’m fucked. Now I can’t order anything else. So every time I’m in there now I order the brick oven grandma pie. Round, thin crust. I don’t do thick crusts. There’s another Villa in Howard Beach and Park Slope, but this is the best one. Grandma pies from Villa.

## Turntable Lab
When I think of record stores, I first think of Rock and Soul, but something about Turntable Lab ends up being a little better for me. They really cater to the DJ in a certain way that no one else does. Rock and Soul sells records; so does Turntable Lab. It’s just that the Lab is so much more committed to being straight to the DJ. Practically everyone who works at that spot is a DJ, which is completely different from going to a spot run by entrepreneurs who happen to be selling audio equipment. If the latter will be like, “oh, there’s 15 kinds of headshells, so we’re going to sell all 15,” the Lab guys will tailor it for DJs and say, “no, we’re just gonna sell the three headshells that DJs should have.” Also (and again, because they’re all DJs), the selection is more relevant to people who are DJing today. Right now. They have the newest gear available and ready to try out - you walk in, it’s all there in front of you. You don’t have to sort through it or have a crazy conversation with someone about finding this and that. They also stay in touch with you in a way that’s somehow not annoying - their emails are actually dope! What business do you know that sends dope emails that make you want to come back to the store? 

The most impressive thing about Turntable Lab, though, is that they treat everyone who walks in the door the same way. Doesn’t matter if it’s me or someone just starting to learn how to DJ, they let relationships build up organically. That’s super dope to see a crew like that treat all of their customers with respect - like they’re DJs.

## Tom, Dick & Harry
Tom, Dick & Harry is the hood superstar store. When we were coming up, you went to Tom, Dick & Harry because Tony had all the sneakers before anyone else. And he would let you buy them early. This was before there were release dates and rules about “oh, you can’t have these before Foot Locker gets them” or whatever. Shit landed at the store and that was it. You always went to Tom, Dick & Harry - almost like it was a stop on the way to any destination - because at any given moment, there could be a shirt, a hat, a jacket, or sneakers that you didn’t even know you needed. It would always be there first.

Because it was so close to Marcy - if you were out there with Jay or Jaz or anybody - Tom, Dick & Harry was consistently the one place we’d go to if we were in the area. No matter what else we were doing that day. “Let’s go see what they got.” And Tony had all the Airs. Every color of the Air Force 1 that came out, they got it. Jordans was cool, too, but in the hood, Airs was bigger than anything. Don’t get it confused - we all loved our specialty basketball shoes, Pippens, all of that - but at that time, it was Airs. Nothing else mattered  And they had all the fresh gear, so whenever you were at TomDees, it was like a one-stop shop. You could buy everything, walk away, and be fresh.

## Bonus: Spicy Action
Spicy Action is a completely different monster. It came in a little later than TomDees. That’s right across the street, though. It didn’t look anywhere near as pretty (it still doesn’t look as pretty) but their whole thing was having crazy shit that no one else had. Early. It’s a come in, buy your sneakers, get out kinda spot. But they had shit that even TomDees didn’t - so if you were looking for something and it wasn’t at TomDees - you’d stop in at Spicy and chances were that you’d find it there. 

There are four sneaker spots on this block alone, but you always went to TomDees first. Then, later on, when this sneaker thing started going off for kids in the street, Spicy had them covered. This dude, I swear to God, he’ll have ten pair size 13 of anything I’m looking for. Even today when we walk in. Guaranteed. I don’t know how he does it. It’s weird. ...He’s good. I’m not going to say nothing else about him besides the fact that he’s good. He’s really, really good.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Your hood can’t last if you don’t support the independent businesses in it. It can’t survive. Independent businesses are the cornerstone of the neighborhoods they sit in - they’re the DNA of their communities. When you walk into Tom, Dick & Harry, you gotta think - we’re in the middle of the hood. So that means they better be friends with everyone in the area - otherwise, they’ll disappear. They go extinct. When you go to the hood and you see race relations that are completely retarded, but you walk in the store and it’s like everyone’s cool because they all know the owner and vice versa, you’re like, “okay, everything’s not so bad. Maybe there is some hope out here.” 

It’s a testament to the owners that we still love going back to these places. Understand me - at my age, I shouldn’t even be thinking about going back to these spots because I don’t live anywhere near them anymore. But everyone at Spicy, TomDees, they know I’ll be back. And they’re happy to see me when I am. Independent business is the fabric, man. It’s an essential part of a neighborhood’s legacy...so if I’m not coming back, I cut off a part of my history. I cut off a part of who I am.
