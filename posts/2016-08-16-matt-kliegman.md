## Grand Army
Grand Army is a bar on State and Hoyt (about three blocks from where I live) that’s run by a couple of excellent restaurateurs - [Noah] Bernamoff and Julian [Brizzi]. Every neighborhood needs a local, and Grand Army is quickly becoming that for Boerum Hill just a year into business. The drinks are great, the oysters are awesome, and it feels really comfortable. I get the same kind of feeling at Grand Army that I hope our customers associate with The Smile.    

## GRDN
GRDN is also on Hoyt right next to Mile End by the parking lot - that’s where I buy my plants and herbs. I find gardening to be a really therapeutic activity. GRDN is just a beautifully merchandised store with a great assortment of flowers, herbs, plants, supplies, and accessories. The way they curate that assortment is really fantastic. I’m pretty sure they’ve been around for a while; it was the first shop we walked into when we moved into the neighborhood. They recently gave my wife a bunch of flowers for a dinner party we were hosting - we would have gladly paid full price for them, but they were like, “no, no - they’ll only be good for a few days.” It’s a really nice thing to be able to build that personal connection with business owners in your area. We’re getting there with the GRDN guys.

## The Primary Essentials
The Primary Essentials is a really fantastic store on Atlantic. They specialize in curating home goods, books, and objects that you probably won’t find anywhere else. There are so many random things that you didn’t know you needed that you’ll end up buying at Primary - I recently walked out with a bunch of pillows and this set of old brass nails. They care so much about the selection of goods on the floor there, and the atmosphere is so peaceful and serene. It’s just one of those places that you’re always drawn to. I’m a big supporter of places that can maintain a feeling of authenticity, and Primary really delivers on that across the entirety of their business.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
To answer that, I think it’s important to understand the risk you’re taking when you decide to start your own business. The very nature of that undertaking is - if you don’t hit a homerun your first time out, the reality is that it gets significantly harder to start another one. Things never go to script, there aren’t any safety nets for you to fall back on, and the whole journey is mostly trials and tribulations. Additionally, the conditions that you can’t control personally aren’t getting any easier to deal with - whether we’re talking rent or whatever else. 

So, one of the special things about independent business owners is that the emotional investment they put into their businesses is incomparable. When you walk into any of the places I just mentioned, you know that they’re very intimate, full reflections of who the owners are. The personality you experience and associate with independent businesses is something that you just can’t find at larger chains, or even a company that’s setting itself up to become a bigger chain. So, in effect, choosing to support an independent business is an act of respect; it’s acknowledging the tremendous risk and challenges inherent to starting your own thing.
