## The Love Cafe
We’re at The Love Cafe up in East Harlem! This place is really special to me because it’s one of the first spots that embraced me in the neighborhood. The owner, Pat, has this incredibly warm energy around him - I love the way he runs the cafe and how he connects with the neighborhood. If you look across the street, you can see that we’re right by a high school. All of the guys who work here are so helpful to faculty members and encouraging to the students - it’s a great space for everyone to discuss what’s stressing them out and talk about issues in a way they might not be able to at school. 

Everything they serve at Love is amazing and affordable - you can get a full meal for five or six bucks. I’ve been coming here for about seven years, now. It’s been awesome to watch them expand and grow while staying true to the neighborhood around them. There’s such a good vibe here. If anyone I know is around East Harlem I always make sure to send them to Love first.

## Fierce Nail Spa
OK, so the real thing about Fierce Nail Spa is the owner Guadalupe’s story. Guadalupe is from Mexico - she immigrated here and started working for a big chain called Dashing Diva, where she wasn’t treated, let’s say, with the most respect. Not to shit on Dashing Diva, but that’s how it went down. So when she started looking for work at other nail shops, she noticed that there was a void in Harlem. I can definitely attest to that; me and most other girls in the neighborhood would always go get our nails done downtown because there wasn’t a spot that had good products and service near us. 

So, Guadalupe decides to go her own route and opens up Fierce in the neighborhood...and, man, I just really saw her go through the ringer. People would come in and say crazy discriminatory things to her in front of her kid, complain about the prices, everything. But she held her ground and really invested a lot into the quality of the product and experience - every cent that I spend at Fierce is well worth it. Her daughter, Michelle, is also an incredible artist; I’ll bring in insane photos from magazines or Instagram and she’ll recreate them perfectly on my nails. I push these guys as frequently as I can on social - Michelle’s gone on to do nails for Serena Williams, Ashanti, and a bunch of other people. That makes me really happy.

The shop we’re at right now is actually Fierce’s second location, and I’m sure Guadalupe will open another one soon because she’s been so successful. Every time I’m in here it’s like I’m talking with my aunt. Her perseverance and story are so important to me, man.

## Row House
Row House is kind of new to the neighborhood - I’ve been coming here for about a year. It’s really nice because it’s so versatile - you can come here for a quick meeting, brunch, dinner, drinks after a long day, whatever - everything will be super on point and everyone on the team is great. It’s just the spot; this is quickly becoming the Cheers of our neighborhood. Shoutout to the oysters, too - the oysters are awesome. I guess the big cosign for Row House is that you’ll always see people from downtown here, as well. So, yeah, Row House is probably where you’ll find me if you’re in this part of Harlem. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
It’s important to me to support independent businesses because they always make me think of family. I’m always motivated by the stories, courage, and struggles of people who take a chance. I know so many people - whether they’re family members, friends, or anyone else - who never take a shot at opening their dream business. That’s just asking for a life filled with regrets, you know? So I really respect people who do capitalize on opportunity...people like Guadalupe, who barely spoke English when she moved here, but dove into teaching herself the language and business fundamentals so she could get Fierce off the ground. 

Additionally, independent businesses are so important to building community. There’s nothing better than walking into a store or a salon or a restaurant that you feel like you’re a part of. That, I’d say, is the most gratifying part about supporting independent businesses for me.
