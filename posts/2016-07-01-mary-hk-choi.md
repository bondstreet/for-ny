  It’s funny but when someone asks you to pick a place in New York you start
  thinking of quintessential New York places. Places that might make some
  hayseed Field Mouse feel jealous that they don’t have access to something so
  cool or particular. Like Jay Z and Beyoncé go to my favorite pizza place but
  talking about that place feels disingenuous because it’s too Yelp review. I
  want to talk about places that are built into my actual day-to-day because
  they provide sanctuary in a neighborhood that’s so overrun with strollers and
  a milquetoast kind of affluent white person that would give away their pet
  once they have their third kid. I’m stricken that I don’t have a deli to talk
  about because I’m in between bodegas and the one closest to me has a trash
  chip game and is a waste of time. I think about this at least twice a day.

## Cobble Hill Coffee Shop

I eat at this diner almost every day. It used to be the donut shoppe but they redid the interior and branding to be more inviting which upset me greatly. It's not, like, soignée but that's precisely why I love it. All the decisions make sense. I love the way they use a little hot water to heat up the cups before they fill it with decent-but-not-great coffee. I love the tiny, pill-bottle sized freshly squeezed orange juice they bring you gratis. I love that they sometimes don't bring it to you and don't tell you why. I love that people have to wait outside even if you have kids and put up a big stink about it. I love knowing who cuts the grapefruit segments really well and who doesn't. I love that they have three types of hot sauces ranging from Tabasco to Red Devil and that Tapatio is also an option. I love that they DON'T have Sriracha because the white dad demanding Sriracha at a diner can go straight to hell because overhearing him on any topic will make me want to die. I love that sometimes when I'm sitting at the bar I have to move if I'm in Carlito's favorite seat because having a fruit salad in that seat is a big part of his day. I love that the people who work there actually seem to enjoy each other's company. It's just a really good vibe and when I see people I know in there I get territorial and salty.

## Sahadi's

This place is the GOAT. It's taken a long time but I've gotten my Sahadi's haul strategy down to a level that I'm ridiculously proud of. There are two sections that are total gems, the pickles and “other sundries” section and the prepared food section. You have to take a number. I love places that have orderly processes. It's what I love about New York, that Soup Nazi M.O. shit that is necessitated by just how many fucking people you have to contend with for your resources. I'm full-time freelance and I think being able to go to Sahadi's in the dead-zone of 3PM to get my labne and in-house made za'atar pita chips provides a type of joy that reaffirms most of the decisions I've made about my career. Also, I don't know why but prosciutto here is a few bucks cheaper than anywhere else and sometimes they have pernil which is just some next-level decision making at a middle eastern spot that I respect and admire. Oh, also their bulk sesame seeds are cheap as hell and the cinnamon almonds and the wee pickles with garlic are life changing.

## Book Court

This place has a better comic book section than it needs to which I appreciate (even though the store totally has that personality where they'd parse the difference between comic books and 'graphic novels', which, LOL). And ever since they built in the back room with a skylight it's just a pleasure to stroll through. It's weird I had a kindle for a long time and loved it but I've gone back to pulp and it's been great. I also actually jibe with their Staff Picks. I like a bookstore that feels like a video rental place or record store because that curmudgeonly wealth of knowledge makes a huge difference. The Internet makes discovery processes so impersonal and logarithmic so an unobtrusive but trustworthy Staff Picks bookshelf is just pleasant.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

This is going to sound completely cracked and paranoid but I have this fear of the world outside of New York. I'm scared of the global economy. I'm scared of the motivations that fuel a hyper-capitalism that renders the independent business financially unsound and totally stupid and emo as a prospect. I get anxious when Big Box oligarchs raze whole sections of family-owned enterprises because I think they’re Trojan Horses filled with homophobia and Islamophobia and a prison system that’s financed by recidivism and an economy that runs on debt and criminalizing poverty. I’m not saying that there isn’t provincialism and small-mindedness and racism in New York I’m just saying that sometimes the America that surrounds New York scares me. By dint of all of us being crammed in here together no matter where we’re from and trying to keep ourselves afloat by feeding each other and creating commerce between each other as a symbiotic city is a type of arrangement that makes getting along and considering each other a priority. Plus, my parents are small-business owners. There’s real honor and pride there.
