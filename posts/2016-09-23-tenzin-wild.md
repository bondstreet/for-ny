Shigure
Shigure is a Japanse izakaya bar on Church Street down in Tribeca. It’s easily one of the coziest, most comfortable, and delicious places in the city. I’m always there for drinks, dinner, or both. The atmosphere is great, low-key, and everything is very reasonably priced. The owners and staff are all super nice, as well! I wish they would open a few more locations throughout the city.

The ARChive of Contemporary Music
The ARChive of Contemporary Music is a local record shop that my wife and I used to live across the street from. We recently got ourselves a vintage record player as part of a larger plan to start collecting records. You can really find anything you’re looking for in the vast selection of vinyl at this spot. Some of the LPs we’ve purchased from here are ones we previously owned copies of but lost along the way, while others are new discoveries that we’d never heard before. There’s an amazing variety of music that you can comb through here.

Green Fingers Market
Satoshi Kawamoto, the creative mind behind Green Fingers Market, is a plant artist who advocates and maintains a unique sense of style - it revolves around an alluring presentation of nature’s innate beauty that gradually transforms with passage of time. Overseeing the direction of seven shops in the greater Tokyo area, Satoshi is a stylist who works across a wide range of genres. 

In recent years, Satoshi has held exhibitions of his work, communicating the beauty of greenery from his unique perspective. All of his output and decisions seek to enrich the ways in which people relate to flora and fauna on a daily basis. 

Why is it important to support independent businesses?
It’s important to support independent businesses because they preserve and enrich the culture of New York (and every city or community, really). By losing independent businesses we forfeit what originally makes cities great and unique.
