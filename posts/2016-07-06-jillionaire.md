## Scarr’s Pizza
J: I started going to Scarr’s because I used to go to L’asso a lot. As far as fancy, upscale pizza is concerned, L’asso is one of the best joints in the city. At least for me. So when Scarr, who used to work everywhere from L’asso to Lombardi’s to Joe’s, left to start his own spot up - I basically just followed him. The food’s great; I almost had a heart attack the first time I went in there thanks to their meatball sub, which is toasted and has (obviously) a ton of meatballs and cheese in it. Really simple but it’s an amazing sandwich. As you can see, the interior and signage is crazy too - Scarr designed it so the space looks like something straight out of a movie from the ‘70s or ‘80s. This place is tight.

## Cheeky Sandwiches
J: Cheeky probably has the best chicken biscuit in the city. It’s really in the cut down here on Orchard - if you didn’t know what you were looking for, you’d walk right past it. In fact, I know that I want that chicken biscuit and I’ll still miss the door sometimes like “yo, what happened?” It’s definitely one of my favorite spots downtown. Actually, I blame this guy sitting next to me for putting me on. I’ve known OJ for almost ten years now - easy - and I’ve learned a lot from him. Mostly bad stuff. Anyways, that’s Cheeky. Oh, the owner is a chef from New Orleans.

OJ: Yeah, he used to actually be a model and one day decided, “nah, fuck that - I wanna cook.” So that’s it - now he makes these chicken sandwiches wearing the same white v-neck all day every day. That’s the chef.

J: It gets crazy busy and it’s a small space, but if you go during off hours you can catch them when it’s kind of quieter.

OJ: You know who I used to see in there all the time? Leonardo DiCaprio. He’d roll down the block on his CitiBike, get off, roll right in, his beard would follow, and he’d walk out with a chicken sandwich. All the time.

J: You gotta respect that guy.

## La Petite Mort
J: This is OJ’s spot. OJ - what should I say about LPM?

OJ: Ummmm…as much as LPM is a commercial space where they sell stuff, it’s more of a community center. They sell really great vintage and incredible work by local artists and designers who show here. Oh and once in awhile we’ll get bored and throw really big, crazy concerts in the middle of the street.

J: And somehow, I’ll always end up getting involved.

OJ: Yes. This is just a place for people who are used to being told no a lot, they need someone to tell them yes, and I’m usually the guy who’ll give them that yes. I try to fulfill whatever dreams they have. I’m just a neighborhood guy doing neighborhood things. Trying to hug the block without selling drugs!

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
J: New York City is eating itself alive. There are spots that we would have gone to for this feature five years ago that don’t exist today. Despite that, the underlying appeal of New York is that you can come here and do something interesting with your life. People come to this city to manifest their dreams, to make something of themselves, however you want to put it. It’s important to support people who put their heart, soul, and last dollar into something they believe in. If I didn’t have that standard to inspire me, I wouldn’t have my own independent business. I wouldn’t have known where to begin. It’s easy to collect a check from a big, faceless company - the more worthwhile thing is helping people you know succeed and pursue their dreams.
