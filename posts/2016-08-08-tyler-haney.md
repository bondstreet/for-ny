## Pasquale Jones
All about the Clam Pizza. Seriously, go try it. Pasquale Jones is a gem. It’s right up the street from my apartment, the OV offices, and our store, so it’s become our go-to spot for entertaining and nourishment. It’s good food, good wine, good friends every time you’re there. Grant Reynolds, one of the partners (and a bonafide wine genius), has amazing taste. Also, it’s worth taking a trip to the bathroom to see an awesome image of James Brown exiting his PJ with flair while you wait.

## Meta Flora
You’ve likely spotted one of Marisa Competello’s magical arrangements before - they’re the eye candy in many downtown spots, including: Dimes, Sky Ting, and OV. :) Marisa is a flower angel and makes the most beautiful arrangements that explode your heart and eyes. I met Marissa through my pals Krissy and Chloe when they somehow got me to attend her dance class, Moves, in a studio below Sky Ting. I’m far from a tremendous dancer - but Moves is an absolute ball and Marissa, Krissy, Chloe are all so inspiring. The Outdoor Voices shop on Lafayette gets weekly deliveries from Metaflora, but it’s always fun to stop by her place and see the latest creations in person.

## Visibility
Visibility founders and great friends, Joey and Sina, are setting out to be the next great American product design studio. I am so impressed with their work. We first collaborated on an Outdoor Voices x Visibility Shapes Bundle - an elevated set of yoga accessories made out of natural materials - for Wallpaper’s Handmade. That initial idea evolved into a solid cork set of yoga blocks, which we released this spring. It’s always more fun to work with friends.

## Bonus: Outdoor Voices
Had to give OV a shout as Ana Kras designed the interior with the intention of it being a three month pop-up, and we keep extending the lease because we love the space so much. We’re going on our 8th month, after which we’ll finally transition into a permanent space around the corner in October. The team who works here is fantastic and they put up with me taking meetings while lounging on the mats.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Keeping it local is really important to me. I grew up in Boulder, CO, which has a really small town feel - you walk into a place and are bound to recognize someone. After a few years in New York I’ve been able to create that sense of familiarity for myself here, too. I live on Baxter just around the corner from OV’s HQ on Canal, our shop is just up the street on Broome, and our new store and HQ will be opening a block away on Centre Street. The restaurants and bars I go to, the stores I shop in, the studios I visit, they’re all in the neighborhood. It’s nice to feel like you have a community.
