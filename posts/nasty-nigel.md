## Leo’s Latticini-Mama’s

Leo’s, aka Mama’s, is such a staple in the Corona community. At a certain point, everything kind of came and went in this neighborhood - so many people moved out - and Mama’s is kind of the only one that stayed true. They never sold out. They might not know how to use email over there, but the food is always banging. You don’t need social media if you’re this important to a community, you know? Everyone looks out and makes sure that there’s a support system there. Mama’s treats you like family, and that’s why you keep going back. You want to see how everyone’s doing and if they have anything new on the menu...and if they don’t, whatever you always get is banging, anyways.

## Benfaremo - The Lemon Ice King of Corona

Lemon Ice King was always just the spot to go to. If you’re taking the train, it’s right at the middle point before you get to Flushing Meadow Park. It’s super cheap and quick - you line up, you get your icy, and keep it moving to the park or wherever else you’re trying to get to in Queens. That’s why they’re so successful, that and because they put so much thought and love into the product.

## Rincon Criollo

Man, the Rincon spot? I remember that’s always where my mom got cuban sandwiches from. It’s crazy because there isn’t a big Cuban community in this part of Queens, but there legit isn’t a single place I know besides this one that does traditional, fire Cuban like them. Nobody. Maybe in the Lower East Side but not even that. I’ve been coming here since I was five or six - when my mom would get off work we’d meet up with her and eat there.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

It’s important because we have to maintain the character of neighborhoods. If every neighborhood was full of chains, what would be the point of venturing out of yours? I’m not going to another neighborhood to get Starbucks or McDonald’s there. Local businesses make sure that communities thrive and grow. They let visitors learn new things and make sure that the people who live here can be proud of where they’re from.
