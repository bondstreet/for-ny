## Variety Coffee
Everyone in New York's got these vectors we move through everyday. I've always been a big coffee drinker, but until I moved to East Williamsburg seven years ago, I wasn't lucky enough to live near a great coffee shop. Since then, it's become part of that daily vector—someone else's business that's become an extension of my own life. My days feel patently off without stopping in there first. And while it happens to be one of the best coffee shops in the city, it's so much more to me—and the neighborhood—than that. I've worked my ass off there: It's the place where I ran Gawker out of for a year on weekends early on in my career, from the moment they opened, until the moment they closed. I've made friends there. I've learned about things there, from the people behind the counter, my neighbors, and so on. There's not enough space here to write as effusively in praise of Variety as it deserves, so I'll just say this: Their cold brew is the shit, drinkable year-round, miss at your own peril.

## Crest Hardware
By all appearances, just another hardware store, until you get to know Harrison, the Macaw who chills in the garden center, or Franklin, the (second-generation) owner Joe Franquinha's pot-bellied pig who's posted in the backyard. It's a hardware store that hosts art shows, Halloween parties, short film festivals. It's a hardware store where people have worked for fifty years. It's a hardware store that has everything you need, and nothing you don't. It's a hardware store that doubles as a community center. It's a hardware store where you'll walk around in the backyard on a Sunday afternoon and look at plants because it's just a nice, meditative thing to do, and they're totally okay with people doing that. So yeah, it's just a hardware store, but also, a weirdly inspiring and perfect one for this neighborhood, where it's become a weirdly critical institution, and not just because they sell hammers. But yes: Hammers are also important, and this is where you go in Williamsburg to buy one.

![Diner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Foster%20Kamer%20Diner.jpg)
## Diner
Diner's become one of the most essential restaurants in the city simply by being itself, not kowtowing to trends, not making any kind of changes as the neighborhood around it has shifted entirely. It's a fussy place—it's loud, it's fun, it's built into an old dining car, most of the menu (which changes, daily) is written on butcher paper on your table, and your meal will soundtracked with anything from Leonard Cohen to Lil' Wayne (possibly in the same hour). It's got one of the most romantic locales in the city, smack under the Williamsburg Bridge. But the brilliance of Diner is its out-and-out utility: You can stop in dolo for coffee and eggs, or a burger and beer. You can also get some of the most brilliantly composed dishes on that same menu at a party of a meal with friends. It's the rare place that manages to have something for everyone, and again, it's become that place by not giving a shit about what's happened around it. Anyway: If I care about you as a human being, we've probably eaten at Diner together, or will at some point. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
It's not hard to see why supporting independent businesses is substantially important to supporting what you love about a city. Just flip the proposition, right? You vote with your wallet. Is supporting chain stores and franchises backing what you love about New York? If the answer is "yes," please flush yourself back to Jersey, or Rockland County, or Cleveland, or wherever. I don't know about you people, but I moved here to move to Nora Ephron's New York, DFA's New York, Spy's New York, and so much of those people's output and the New York that helped them create it revolved around the way they transacted their lives when they weren't doing that. And those people weren't going to Whole Foods, or some shitty midtown sad desk salad chain—they were going to Katz's, Diner, Elaine's, etc. When you support this city's independent businesses, you support the identity of New York as established and defined and propagated by those who live here, who want it to be better than the increasingly indistinguishable, suburban, and middlebrow lameass identity of growing cities around the country. We put up with too much shit here to not have it be better than that. Otherwise, we all might as well move to Jersey.
