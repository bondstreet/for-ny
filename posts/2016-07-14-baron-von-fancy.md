## The Odeon
The Odeon is my favorite place to eat. I’ve been coming here for as long as I can remember - it’s a place that’s a true constant in the neighborhood...somewhere I’ve always gone and will always go to. I just can’t imagine Tribeca without it; The Odeon, the sign, the bench - they’re all I’ve ever known and seen on that corner since I was little.

## Franklin Cleaners
I absolutely have a family-level relationship with my cleaners. I live in a tiny studio apartment without a laundry machine so I find myself at Franklin constantly. It is owned and operated by the Kim family who I simply adore. They have some pieces I made for them hanging up above the front counter. Besides just keeping my jammies fresh, the Kims are fantastic people. We always share a laugh and I appreciate knowing that they’re always there for me.

## Arcade Bakery 
Arcade is tucked all the way in the far corner of this giant office building’s lobby. Their operation makes the whole place smell like bread right out of the oven as soon as you walk in. I love all of their baked goods...just passing by the office building means that I’m walking in; there’s no escaping it. This happens to me on a nearly daily basis. So yeah, the location is really weird and doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense at face value, but anyone who’s tried anything they make will tell you that it’s completely amazing. Arcade adds a lot of flavor to the neighborhood in so many ways...and that is why i love it.  

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Flavor in any community comes from the people and businesses who live and work in it. They define the whole formula. So it goes without saying that the more unique and independent the businesses in a community are, the more unique that community will be.
