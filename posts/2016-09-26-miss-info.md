## Marie Nails
It’s taken me a while to learn this but, you know what the fuck luxury is? Endurance and mutability. So, not butter soft leather and not stupid bowling shirts with airbrush greco-roman murals on it. Yes, shots. Luxury is being able to get your nails painted so they look like gleaming pieces of wet fruit and having them stay that way for a whole month whether you’re having high tea and crumpets or digging in your son’s butt. I’ve been getting my nails done by Sayo at Marie Nails since  it was a single-location 2-seat spot in West Hollywood. Now it’s in NYC, LA, Honolulu, and Tokyo but still as intimate and personal as ever. They specialize in Japanese cal gel (which doesn’t damage your nail bed) and nail art; Sayo has hand-painted everything from a Balenciaga rottweiler to a Yayoi Kusama squash on my tiny tips. Here’s another mini-rant…everywhere in this city, we are obsessed with the hook-up economy. Seed, post, resell, gripe. At Marie, they don’t care who you are - they see the glacial rock on your hand, they dead you if you’re 15 minutes late. There is no fancy app to book appointments, there is no Facebook Live, there are no branded candles to take home, there are no freebies. But there are always abundant hello’s and thank you's at Marie. http://marienails.com/

## Lan Zhou Hand-Pulled Noodles 
My husband is one of those prosperity foodies, like Pimp C “we eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning.” He loves rich foods with fancy plating and “seasonal pricing.” I’m good on all the hype, the 3-hour waits, the secret reservation handshakes, the pretty good pasta. If you really want some epic tableside plating, take a detour under the Manhattan Bridge to Lan Zhou and you might see a guy take a lump of dough and alternately stretch and slam it into long chewy noodles on the tiny table right next to you. I recommend a plate of steamed dumplings, a plate of noodles with dry minced pork and bok choy, and an orange soda. Best post-party nightcap dinner in the city. Be clear…it’s the size of a subway shoe-repair shop. The ambiance is also similar. So don’t bring your ewww-face or your dietary restrictions or your food selfie celebs. I need this place. http://www.lamzhouhandmadenoodle.com/

## Friends Work Here 
After my son Max was born, I left Hot97 (becoming a mom was unrelated, but it did put life in perspective, including value of self, and the state of terrestrial radio) and tried working from home on my own projects (missinfo.tv, an upcoming book on hip hop parenting, marketing projects for Stadium Goods, and independent music fashion consulting). I quickly realized it was nearly impossible to ignore the hilarious goon in the other room. After trying coffee shops and WeWorks as alternate offices, I was so lucky to find this independent coworking space just 3 blocks away from home called Friends Work Here. There are inspiring designers, bloggers,  writers, and entrepreneurs who trade wisdom and work, and many of them are fellow Brooklyn parents (which helps with preschool advice). The lovely Swiss matriarch of Friends is Tina Roth Eisenberg, who also runs Tattly and Creative Mornings, and the space itself is bright, cozy, and perfect for working hard and hardly working. http://www.friendsworkhere.com/

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I grew up in independent business. Literally. In a toy store in the South Side of Chicago. The stock room was where I ate dinner, the counter was where I learned math, the mall was my jungle gym. And I internalized the struggle, the hard work, and the dreams of my parents who grew that toy store into one of the most loved Chicago retail businesses, Galt Baby, still operating in downtown Chicago and Lincoln Park 30+ years later. I know how easy it is to go to a tiny store that has the most incredible hand-picked items and then go home to order it right to your front door from Amazon or Walmart. But I want everyone to know how much it means to a small business for you to spend your money with them. Maybe it’s $3.00 more and you have to carry the thing home. But your time, and their time, is priceless. The ability to touch something and hear why that store owner picked it for you is, too.
An algorithm will never be able to tell you why one baby stroller is better for just you and your kid. But my mom has done that for thousands of future independent business owners and customers. And she refuses to retire because she enjoys it so much.
I think independent business means that you have the independence to react to change, re-invest in your team, listen to your audience, and see a project from start to finish. That seems like the goal, whether you are a massive company or a solo contractor. Accountability and an open mind.
