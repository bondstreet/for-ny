## Lil Frankie’s
C: I mean, Frankie is a character - he’s been around forever, and of course the food is fucking amazing. What he was able to do with the location was crazy. Backing East Village Radio right next door and engaging an entirely new, much wider audience with that - that was just awesome to watch. It’s hard enough running one thing, so it’s really inspiring when you see people engaging customers with stuff that, at face value, might have nothing to do with their main business. The station is how we met the Chances With Wolves guys and the rest of that crew. Lil Frankie’s is a spot that’s always been a stable, reliable neighborhood constant. You know exactly what you’re going to get every single time. 

## Lovely Day
M: When I first moved to New York, one of the first places anyone ever took me to was Lovely Day. Actually, my first group of friends in the city were all people who, at the time, were working at Lovely Day. If we weren’t there for dinner, we’d show up after hours, smoke cigarettes inside, have some drinks, and then go out. Everyone’s obviously grown up and moved on with their lives since those days, but Lovely Day was such a great (and really important) starting off point in the city for me. It’s definitely gotten way more popular since, but at the same time everything else about it has remained consistent over the years. That’s something I appreciate tremendously, because it means you’ll always run into people you know whenever you go by...Lovely Day is home for me in a lot of ways. I really respect Kazusa for that - she’s put so much into her business and protected it for so long.  

## UNIS 
M: I met Eunice right after I met Colin - this was as soon as I’d moved to New York ten years ago. At the time, Colin was living in an apartment that was pretty much adjacent to Eunice’s. It was practically them in the same space. So yeah, man, over the past ten years we’ve had such great times with Eunice (both as a person and as a business owner). Seeing her work so hard on her incredible clothing label, build it into what it is today with this tiny crew of people - it’s been cool to watch the brand advance and get glimpses into her process. We’ve learned a great deal from her. 

C: Another thing about Eunice is how much she cares about her neighborhood, the block she lives, on, and small businesses. That’s her heart and, of course, all of it is reflected in her brand. She’s super invested in maintaining the foundations of her community - recently, she got us (and a lot of other cool small businesses) involved with a local charity effort. She was also a huge champion of protecting the Elizabeth St. Garden. I think her customer base for UNIS is as tight-knit and solid as it is because her values are so clearly present across the brand.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
C: Because it’s so hard, dude. They need the help! Whether you like it or not, independent businesses are where new, great ideas are generated. Then they grow from there and are ultimately snatched up and co-opted by big corporations. So yeah, you should support independent businesses because otherwise there’s nothing for big ones to sustain themselves with. That’s kind of a dark way of looking at it, I guess. 

M: Big businesses, small ones - they all exist together in an ecosystem. But independent businesses are where originality, individuality, and great ideas come from. By supporting them, you’re demonstrating that you care about all of that. I wish more people like landlords and the IRS cared the same way.

C: My big problem is, whenever I find a small, awesome, local spot, I want to never say anything about it because that’s how they become tourist traps. At the same time, I’m well aware that these businesses need the publicity if they’re going to survive. So if anyone’s figured out how to balance that, please let me know.
