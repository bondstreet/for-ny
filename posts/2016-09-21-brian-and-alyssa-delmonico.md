## Elm Health
This is our go to health spot for juices, smoothies, healthy food products, supplements and essential oils. They have it all! The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable. We really enjoy shopping at this local spot opposed to the bigger chain health food stores. Never long lines and we can quickly grab what we need.

## Pierre Loti
Cute date spot or to meet friends for a drink. It's dark, intimate and has a sexy vibe. Music is great, and sometimes live music. We love the simplicity of the menu and that local farmer's market ingredients are used.

## Bite
Quick healthy place for lunch. Mediterranean salads, sandwiches & soups. It has a cool, relaxed vibe, lots of natural light, and super friendly staff. Feels like a mini-mediterranean break in our day. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Since we have our own independent business, it's really important for us to support our local community and fellow entrepreneurs. We love the character, flair and uniqueness that each independent business brings to the area, and we want to see them stick around. We also know that they are providing plenty of jobs and opportunities, and we want to contribute to their overall success. By supporting independent businesses we also feel a deeper connection to our neighbors and find it to be a more enjoyable overall experience.
