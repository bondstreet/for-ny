## Coming Soon New York
S: We been friends with the Coming Soon girls since forever. Amazing furniture. Amazing home goods. They have the dopest stuff. 

L: The best thing is how clear it all is in there - it’s their point of view and that perspective just happens to be cool as shit. They’re obviously not the only furniture store in the city, but to me they might as well be. The way they express themselves makes Coming Soon so different from anything else. 

S: I’d rather drop fifteen hundred on something at Coming Soon than at Design Within Reach any day. Not just because their personality comes through in the selection, but because Helena and Fabiana, they show love all the time. I met them through a friend a while ago and we hit it off while we were starting to build our spot out. Immediately, they were the ones who showed us the most love. I’m not trying to judge no one else on the block, but for being right across the street, they were super genuine with it right away. They were also our first customers as soon as we opened our doors. Anything we needed, they’ve always held us down. So - the way we were raised in the streets - when people show us love, it’s only natural that we reciprocate. 

L: They get that sense of community. Like Scarr said, the way we were raised out here, if someone moves into the neighborhood, we’re not going to make it awkward for them. Immediately, it’s “hey, what’s good, how can we help you?” 

S: We’re here for you. That’s how it used to be - that’s how New York was. Now, if you try the same thing, 9 out of 10 times people get awkward about it like I’m trying to rob you or something. Everyone has their guard up now.

## La Petite Mort
L: OJ just the local, man. 

S: I known OJ a crazy long time, man. The wild part is, him and Los came up in the same neighborhood and they didn’t really know each other until we were all on the same block right here!

L: I would see OJ out at like parties and shit - we grew up all over the LES. LPM is a reflection of that, you know? New York shit. It’s local products, a local concept, run by a very local dude. 

S: He might toe the line a little bit when it comes to the hipster shit, but you can’t knock the man’s hustle (laughs). We all gotta eat. 

L: LPM is a classic mom and pop spot, man. It’s a perfect reflection of OJ, his point of view, his fashion, and the era he came up in here. It’s genuine as fuck.

S: Especially when you consider where people like OJ and us come from. That makes it extra impressive that he has something of his own. People don’t understand that we grew up with nothing. Literally. I’m not even talking about not having something to inherit from parents or family or whatever, we didn’t even have it in our minds that an investor was something that existed. Straight up. All of us, our money comes from us busting our ass. That’s it. 

L: Like Beanie Sigel said, “here is something you can’t understand.”

![Gohan](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Gohan.jpg)
## Gohan
S: Gohan is run by a husband and wife duo who I’ve known since they had Lovely Day. This was when I was working at Lombardi’s as a server like twelve years ago. I used to walk by Lovely Day all the time, so I saw the progression from it being empty the first six months to it becoming impossible to get a seat because all the fashion people in New York were there every night. I just used to go in because it was affordable and I love the ginger chicken - 

L: - the chicks.

S: Yeah (laughs), there were a lot of girls. A loooooooooooooot of girls. 

L: So Gohan is their new spot. It’s a breath of fresh air, to be honest. 

S: We have a lot of restaurants, both old and new, in this neighborhood, but few are as good as Gohan. Even fewer - and this is the real beauty of Gohan - are as healthy with everything they serve. It tastes like home cooking. I’ve had a lot of great Japanese food and this place stands apart, completely.

What really strikes a chord with me is how family-driven this place is. You see their kid in the back and everyone working the line. That really reminds me of how I grew up. My first job at fifteen was working the counter at the bodega in the worst projects imaginable. Dealing with the worst people ever. Then my next job was at Ballato’s - everyone thinks of Ballato’s as this hot spot now but this was when no one except locals knew about it. And both of these operations, the bodega, Ballato’s, a lot of other places I’ve worked at down here - they’re all family businesses. There’s something really important about that.

L: Keeping it in the family.

S: Exactly.
 
![Bonus: Goodnight Sonny](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bst-fornyc/Scarr%20and%20Los%20Goodnight%20Sonny.jpg) 
## Bonus: Goodnight Sonny
L: Goodnight Sonny. Old New York bar. Good quality, high standards, reliable, open til late in the morning - I make a lot of great bad decisions here, usually. They just do everything right, honestly. From the service to the food they cook to the drinks they pour, it’s all available and consistent til 4 in the morning. It’s like having a butler, it’s like my nanny. Always there when I need them.

S: Everyone hypes the fuck out of Blue Ribbon - no offense, I love that sushi - but the bistro, I used to go there a lot and I’ll say that Goodnight Sonny is actually the best place to eat after 2 AM. There’s no other spot like it. This is the late night joint. You gotta wait til all the bros filter out and then come through wild late. Their other spot, The Wayland, is low-key fire, too.  

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
S: I know everyone tells you the same thing, but man, I just want to eat AT a restaurant every once in awhile, you know? Everything is a delivery app, now. That’s not what we’re about. What happened to fuckin’ talking with people who work at your local. 

L: Take a walk, you know what I’m saying? I just want to feel like I’m in the hood once in awhile.

S: When you come to our spot, you treat us like family, we treat you like family, that’s it. Simple. It’s no deeper than that. 

L: It’s important to look out for each other. 

S: Talking about family - I was there when Lenny Kravitz bought Ballato’s their awning. He just bought them an awning because Emilio showed him love. Lenny’s still a regular customer over there. He didn’t have to do that, you know? But that’s what we’re talking about - support each other. Why do you need a reason to do that besides the fact that it’s the right thing to do?

L: We in New York - there’s mad people stacked on top of each other. Spread love. It’s easier to be a decent person than it is to be a shithead.
