## San Pietro and New York steakhouses 
I have a long history with New York - one of my favorite things to this day is trying out restaurants I haven’t been to. I’m not really sure if I should give out any specific names or particular spots, though! I’ll usually keep it in the Meatpacking District, or the Village - I’m a big fan of Italian, steak, and seafood over anything else, so any place that is doing something interesting with that kind of cuisine, I’m there. 

One second, John Starks is calling. ...What do you want, John Starks? I’m doing an interview right now, I’ll hit you when I’m done. 

Alright, ok - I’ll give you one: San Pietro. San Pietro on the Upper East Side - I’m pretty sure it’s not there anymore but we used to be at San Pietro a lot. These days, I’ll probably be at Catch or STK. Like I said, seafood and steak.

## Mom & pop movie theaters
Oh, and of course - I’ve always been a big fan of going to the movies! I can’t name a specific theater that’d still be around, but back then, there were absolutely a lot more mom and pop-run theaters throughout the city. Especially in Times Square and in the Village. Then I remember when Magic [Johnson] decided to open his theaters - the one in Harlem and so on. But yeah, I would go to the movies whenever I could and, now that you’re putting me on the spot, it’s funny to remember how so many of them were family-owned operations compared to how it’s all big chains now.

## Print shop
A good friend of mine used to own a printing shop right up the street from the Garden - I’d go up there from time to time to hang out with him. I don’t remember the exact address but it was right on 7th Avenue just a few blocks up. You have to remember that, back then, you really had to go to the shop to get anything printed. So if I needed anything printed at all - cards, photos, anything else - he’d handle that for me. 

[Fabolous walks in]

F: How you been, man?

P: I’m good, man - just got into town.

F: We got you back in the city?

P: Yes sir. You know I always feel good when I’m back in the city.

F: You hit the shop yet?

P: I need to! I just got a cut yesterday so I’m good for a second. Actually, Fab just called it. The Shop (that’s the name of the barber shop) isn’t actually in the city - it’s out in Jersey, but Johnny is the guy there who cuts both our hair. For years now.

F: Man, sometimes I can’t even get in a chair if Pat’s around!

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

P: It’s always a positive thing to support small, local businesses in the city. For all the obvious reasons - small businesses really help grow the economy, they generate jobs for people, they’re good for the communities they’re in - I think all of that is very important.
