## Printed Matter
Say what anyone will - publishing is not dying or dead. I know how self-­fulfilling that sounds coming from someone who slings books, but like, really. The publishing system that is dying and dead is the one that created behemoths like Barnes & Noble and Borders, and guess what. Those guys are losers now. I look at the fallow corner of Sixth Avenue and 8th street where B&N used to do business and am equal parts annoyed and full of indignant joy. How marvelously we fucked ourselves as booksellers. We happy few...the decade and a half of luxury that commercial booksellers enjoyed as gatekeepers of content distribution look fucking quaint in hindsight. The fact that independent bookstores were obliterated by their intransigence is frankly tragic. If you live in New York City and can’t support a local bookstore, seriously, just catch a Pokemon off the Manhattan Bridge.

But the poster-size lithograph HOPE for books is still alive. People are going to keep assembling books in a one-seam format, and so long as Beyonce doesn’t stealth release a “visual scroll,” people will keep selling them that way. Printed Matter is a marketplace for authentic books, as well as an arts archive. They present books with consideration and share profits directly with their creators. This is SO important for the (un)dying arts. And generally speaking, books are the cheapest form of art (second maybe only to un-appraised couture hiding in thrift stores and junk shops). Buying an original Tauba Auerbach or Gary Panter or Paul Chan at Printed Matter can let even the poorest New Yorker feel like a Gagosian.

Also, these guys will let you use their bathroom without purchase. That’s like, a 5­ star Michelin business to me.

## Fat Cat Billiards
Where does one go really late at night if they want to meet friends but don’t want to drink, or even pay the unwarranted courtesy of standing (not even sitting but fucking standing) in loud smelly bars with surly bartenders who charge you two bucks for a ginger ale? I mean don’t get me wrong. I drink. Like, my BMI is a proof, not a percentage. But I like hanging with younger people, and sometimes sober people, and I like having something to do besides pretending we’re all really thirsty for soda. I love playing pool cuz it reminds me of the suburbs and I like ping pong because it makes me feel ironically Asian, and I love the fact that this place plays rad ass jazz. If they served pho and had high speed internet this place would literally be my heaven. It’s a social club with a weird barrier to entry (sometimes they’re dicks about cover), but I like when everyone can hang out late at night and not have to make it about being in a bar.

## Julius
Having said all that I said about non-drinking establishments, “the gay bar” is a social establishment and deserves its own historical preservation classification, and man, I hope this one sticks around. Julius is my favorite gay bar of all time. It’s chill, it’s low­key, it’s high energy, it’s supes cheap, and they make a phenomenal cheeseburger. I’ve come here for quiet biz drinks as well as loud ass birthday parties. And I suppose in some alternate universe where I am actually the gay man I keep thinking I will become, this is the most romantic place in the universe. It’s a neighborhood bar with a unique mandate, but universal appeal.

## Why is it important to support independent business?
Sometimes I think independent businesses are a trick. A lot of them are incubating corporate chrysalises (e.g. Blue Bottle, any fashion design brand). And a lot of independent businesses that stay small are also just run by rich people who got tired of counting other people’s money. I guess what I think is more important than the idea of a business being independent is the idea that it is interdependent. It is crucial that small neighborhood businesses can be inviting to as many of its neighbors as possible, even if they only offer one pinhole-specific idea and product. IMHO, the most important element of a small, local business in New York is the element of economic sincerity. New York City has one of the highest populations of working poor who can’t afford rent, and we share walls with “Million Dollar Deal” Bravo characters. I hate thinking that with such a rich culture of social environments at their disposal, the majority of New Yorkers can only feel comfortable at a McDonald’s (no offense to the McRib) because it’s not advertised in Helvetica.
