## Canal Plastic Center
To me, one of the draws of New York is how fragmented it is. In the cracks, you can find strange gems like Canal Plastic Center, which doesn’t seem like it should exist in this city but totally does. This place is fiercely loved by many in New York’s arts / tech community.

I first stumbled in here off a recommendation from my friend and collaborator Adam Harvey, when I was working on my first installation. Canal Plastic Center stocks a wealth of plastics, vinyl of all kinds, and it also has that dingy Cantonese-run charm to it. You can really trip out looking at the textures and reflections here - it’s a sugar rush of eye candy and material inspiration while you’re ideating on new projects.

## Sun’s Organic Garden Tea Shop
In an alternate universe, I would be an older Asian lady with a tea shop in Chinatown just like this one. There’s something about this shop that I find very special; you can tell it’s the shop owner’s own sanctuary, not just a store. There’s an impressive variety of teas in large glass canisters - both traditional and medicinal - with hand written labels and “Do Not Touch!” warnings on every single one. I’ve come here before and asked for custom blends, and she mixes them by hand for you. It’s a bit of zen tucked away in New York’s otherwise raucous Chinatown. Definitely stop by...but don’t ask for Bubble Tea. They don’t mess with that here.

## Spoonbill & Sugartown
Spoonbill & Sugartown is a Williamsburg staple. I’ve spent hours here perusing the collection, and it also makes for a great meeting spot for perpetually tardy friends (of which I am one.) It can be financially dangerous to spend too much time at Spoonbill, but I’ve found some real gems for my collection while sifting aimlessly through the racks.  

## Why is it important to support small businesses?
Small businesses are the bedrock of entrepreneurship. They make up the tapestry of a city; in New York in particular they are an essential part of what makes our creative ecosystem as vibrant as it is. On a personal note, I’m always attracted to the specific details that make an independent business tick...the smallest design flourishes and idiosyncrasies that make a space feel familiar.
