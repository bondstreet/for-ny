## Japan Premium Beef (and Bohemian)
Sitting next door to us is Japan Premium Beef, which, for my money, is the best butcher in the city. Of course, if it’s the best butcher in New York City, one could easily make the argument that it’s one of the best butchers in the entire world. The crew here maintains a very discreet and small shop, but they’re a big deal - they’re the celebrity draw on the block for sure. I’d like to think that the Future Perfect is, but if I’m being honest, people are coming into our shop all the time holding beef. 

Of course, you then have the element of surprise with Bohemian in the back. There’s nothing I love more than a secret spot with a number and door that’s challenging to find. Both Bohemian and Premium Beef are quintessentially Japanese in how they keep the operation small but laser-focused on craft. The way both spots are set up really reminds me of shopping in Tokyo over anything else in New York. Everything from the presentation of goods (whether it’s salt, meat, t-shirts, or sauces), to the ridiculous chandelier, to the cow sculpture - it’s all so considered and exactly how it should be. Everyone who works there is unbelievably knowledgeable and helpful - having a conversation with them before you buy something will yield the best home-cooked meal you’ll make in your life. It’s not cheap, by any means, but hey - works better than flowers! Just saying.

## John Derian Company
I love homeware shops that are very specific in their leanings. You have to be deliberate in this industry because it’s so easy for customers to get confused if you aren’t. So, if Future Perfect has one very particular point of view, John Derian is almost its diametric inverse - it’s the other end of the spectrum. I absolutely love it there - I’ll buy gifts all the time from John Derian and spend a bunch of time browsing the chockablock selection they’ve got going on. It’s the most glamorous yard sale of all time, and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. If we’re very spare, they’re as spectacularly busy and mixed up as it can get. That juxtaposition is precisely why I love John Derian so much - it’s a great place for me to go and reset my perspectives and thinking. You’ll always find an unexpected gift for the person who has everything here.

## The Future Perfect Secret Spot
We haven’t even officially launched or named the Future Perfect Secret Spot yet! This showroom is a very exclusive and private space for our clients who are interested in something we have to offer but can’t find it in the store. It’s a response to that happening quite a bit, especially as of late. We don’t make the venue available to everyone, but if you’re in here, you’re getting the full survey of what we have on-hand. The inspiration behind this space stemmed a bit from, again, shopping in Japan, where, to find a store or restaurant, you’d have to go through the lobby of an office building, climb down a few flights of stairs, go out the back, into the parking lot, and past a nondescript hallway. That’s such a typical thing out in Asia, but non-ground-floor opportunities are so underexplored here in New York.

Opening the Secret Spot has allowed us to shift our shop at 55 Great Jones to emphasize stories and context around pieces, which is really important in design. If you can use story to ultimately evoke an emotional response around a design object, that’s as special as it gets. This, of course, means we show less things at 55 Great Jones, so (to bring things full circle) the showroom allows us to display everything we don’t have on the floor in a more relaxed manner. The client response to the Secret Spot has been great so far. We’re really excited about it. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Where do you even begin? Independent businesses fuel the fire that is our economy. You go to places like Amazon for all the predictable, routine things you need - and that’s great. But to find all of the stuff that you didn’t know you wanted or needed, everything you want to be pleasantly surprised by - it makes way more sense to spend your dollars at an independent business. These are places where creativity and individual points of view shine - they’re where personality really comes through. Most importantly, you can see your dollar directly supporting the livelihoods, perspectives, and ambitions of the people who independently own businesses. As someone who founded and owns an independent business, that was a really powerful realization for me.
