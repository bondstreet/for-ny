## Master Bike Shop

Master Bike Shop is on 72nd and Broadway, which is really close to my apartment. It’s a cool place that was introduced to me by a friend on our cycling team. Anytime you crash your bike or you need to get something repaired, these guys have the answers - they have their craft down to a science. It’s important that you trust whoever is repairing your bike - the last thing you want when you’re barreling down a hill at 50 miles an hour is for your fork to break or your tire to fall off. Half of the guys there don’t speak English, but when you watch them work it’s clear that you don’t need to explain anything to them - Master is a totally appropriate name for this shop.

## P&K Laundromat

I travel a lot and am always out of clean clothes, so my second spot is P&K Laundromat. I can’t count the number of times this place has stayed open late for me. I’m pretty sure the manager works on-site seven days a week, is always super pleasant to be around, and knows both me and my girlfriend by name. That’s an experience that’s pretty unique to local businesses.

## Oaxaca
My third spot is Oaxaca, our neighborhood taqueria. My girlfriend is a resident, so whenever she’s away or working late, I’m there every night for some pretty long stretches. Everyone there is really friendly - I’ll usually pick up or eat there, but the best thing about Oaxaca is that they’ll always deliver to my apartment even though I live a block away. Good value, great people, awesome food, and convenience - you can’t beat it.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I live in New York because I love New York, and a big part of what makes this city so great are its people and businesses. Local businesses afford you the opportunity to interact with people you otherwise wouldn’t connect with in your daily life or at your job. Having those personal interactions is what makes this city feel real to me. I’m lucky to have a lot of independent businesses in my neighborhood - they’re what makes living on the Upper West Side great. Without them, we’re the suburbs.
