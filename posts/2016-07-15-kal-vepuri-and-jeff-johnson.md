## Cafe Integral
K: Founded by the amazing Cesar Vega, Cafe Integral brings legit Nicaraguan coffee to Soho through their shop, which shares a space with American Two Shot on Grand Street. Through Cesar’s family connections to farms in his home country, he’s built a fair trade system that supports a bunch of communities’ growth via his business. For my money, Cesar produces what I think is the world’s greatest cup of espresso. He’s incredibly talented, puts out incomparable product, and he’s only just getting started. I’m there pretty much every morning for my cold brew.

## Sincerely, Tommy
J: Speaking of shops that share their locations with nice coffee spots, Sincerely, Tommy is this really cool retail concept space out in Bed Stuy. It has this fantastic build-out that highlights young, contemporary designers through a tightly curated selection of pieces. They also sell home goods and special items on occasion. While there’s decidedly a minimalist lens across the whole experience, it never comes off as try-hard or superficial, which I appreciate. While spare, there’s a lot of personality in every decision they’ve made - that keeps the shop fun and, most importantly, memorable. Next time you’re in Bed Stuy you should definitely make a point of checking Sincerely, Tommy out.

## Fig Collective
J: So Fig Collective is out in Bushwick. It’s a super quirky, young boutique that’s by appointment only. You have to walk up to the fourth floor of this industrial building way out to find it. Fig Collective is special because they’re one of the few spaces that carries (almost exclusively) young, upstart, and non-American designers. One of my favorite brands that they stock is called Ader Error, which you can only really order from Korea right now. It’s really cool to visit and see how guys like these are figuring out how to push things forward.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
J: This is something we think about a lot as we build our own business. New York is by no means the cheapest or easiest city to start a company in. In fact, it might be one of the toughest places to make that commitment. The amount of creativity needed to navigate every hurdle this city throws at you speaks to how worthy of your respect businesses that make it here actually are. They’ve succeeded despite nearly insurmountable odds and kept their integrity intact - that definitely stands for something.

K: I would say that every amazing big business was once a small business. Without small businesses you end up missing what makes America so great. I think - well, no, I know - that small businesses are the most important part of the American economy. To Jeff’s point, beyond the economics and the fundamental premise of our employment, I’d reiterate that independent businesses are really driven by passion and creativity. So supporting them is understanding how significant a role they play in pushing culture and the economy forward.
