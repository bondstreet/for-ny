## The Dogpound
Dogpound is my gym; Nigel Barker introduced me to them. The trainers there (who are all family, literally) work with a really wide range of clientele - whether it’s Olympians like me and my boy Conor (Dwyer), actors, supermodels - who have very specific needs. So they’re extremely responsive and adaptive to all these different priorities. They know each body and what the focus needs to be. 

I think a big part of why all of these people come to Dogpound is because the atmosphere is great - no one wants your picture, no one cares who you are, you’re just here to work out really hard. It’s dark, it’s gritty, there aren’t too many lights - it’s not about caring what you look like. You’re here to work. There’s no excuses if you’re late, too - if you’re not on time you’re doing a hundred burpees and they’re already moving on without you. The team at Dogpound will have you do in 45 minutes what another spot would let you breeze through over the course of like, two hours. It’s a real gym.

## Concepts
Concepts is a store that’s very close to me...literally, as they’re around the corner from The Dogpound. I’ve always appreciated how they blend high fashion with streetwear in their presentation at the shop. That keeps the whole experience accessible to everyone who stops in. That said, they’re obviously very selective with the designers who they bring on - whether it’s an established name or an up and coming brand, your line isn’t in Concepts unless you fit with their point of view....with what they’re trying to communicate. That feels different to me from how a lot of other shops, especially recently, will just buy anything and put it all out on the floor. Concepts does a great job of mixing high and low, which is exactly how I like to wear clothes. 

I also like that the people who work at Concepts are super knowledgeable and approachable. Concepts is originally a Boston thing, so obviously opening up a location in New York means you have to show and prove. This city will make or break you. So, it’s really all thanks to the team who works at the West Soho spot that Concepts is able to be so respected here.

## Pier 59 Studios
Pier 59 is like a second home to me. I can’t tell you how many shoots I’ve done here - Nike, which was my first shoot here, to GQ to Self...the list goes on. Everything about Pier is perfect to me - the location, the aesthetic, the incredible people who work here, the food, the natural light, how enormous the studio spaces are. Oh, and the smoothies.

The most important thing is the familiarity, though. Every time I stop by, it’s “Hey Miles! How’ve you been?” I love the Pier team, man - they’re all so warm and happy. I’ve shot at almost every studio in the city and Pier is, by far, my favorite. Because it feels like home more than anything else. I’ve never had a bad experience here. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
That’s just the way I was brought up. Whether it was when I was a kid in London or stopping by the bodega last night, supporting local businesses was just a value I was raised on.

But, I mean, aside from all the usual reasons, just think about starting something new for the first time. Like, you have no prior experience and are still going all in on something you’ve never done before. That’s what independent businesses are doing, right? They’re people, maybe your friends or family, even, who are starting fresh. And imagine if no one around them helped out at the beginning. Everyone needs a little help getting their foot in the door. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. I didn’t get to where I am by myself - you work hard and stay focused, but without good people pushing you it doesn’t happen. When I was competing in the Olympics, I had texts and emails coming in from the people at Dogpound, Pier, Concepts - that was so crucial to know people at home were watching me in that moment. So why wouldn’t I reciprocate, you know? Help people who help you. That’s how we all get ahead.
