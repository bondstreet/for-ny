## La Boîte

Lior worked for me for many years - he was in charge of the spice project for us, mixing blends for Daniel, our other restaurants, and our catering business. Eventually he left, did all sorts of catering projects for a while, and eventually opened La Boîte. It’s fabulous. I’m grateful that he is still able and willing to make customized blends for my restaurants both in the US and abroad. However, he also has an existing collection of blends that we are happy to adapt our menu to, as well. Ultimately, I support Lior because I am intimately familiar with his impeccable reputation as a cook and individual. He’s extremely particular about the sourcing of his spices, the crafting of blends - the process is very special and unique.

## La Colombe

The coffee we use at Daniel is from La Colombe. La Colombe started in Philadelphia but has obviously established an incredible foothold here in New York. I’ve known the partners there for almost 30 years - I really love working with them. They’ve grown their business very carefully and are extremely committed to the craft and the community around them. In this business, it’s critical you cultivate relationships with people you trust implicitly - that’s the only way you can know where they’re going to source ingredients, how they maintain integrity, and so forth.

## Daniel Johnnes Wine Imports

The best and longest business relationships I’ve had are all founded on this sense of trust and camaraderie that has solidified over time. The people who run these businesses make me happy to support them - it’s as simple as that. Daniel was a waiter for me in 1985 - he’s also always been one of the finest sommeliers, so when he started his wine import business we created a special champagne that we use at Daniel to this day. He is the person between me and wine makers - this relationship is what allows us to obtain special barrel selections, make special champagne blends, and wines just for us. This is the important thing about everyone I’ve mentioned so far - they help me craft products that are truly personal to us.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

One day, twenty years ago, a Japanese customer who really appreciated my food, knew me well, and ate at the restaurant all the time, told me, “Daniel, I have to take you to the Bronx.” So we went up to Arthur Avenue and I was introduced to Biancardi, a very iconic, family-run butcher shop in that neighborhood. They have, amongst other items, the absolute best baby goat in the spring. I still go there for myself and on behalf of the restaurant. Anyways, while I was exploring these stores along the avenue, I thought to myself, “wow, these people - all they care about is maintaining tradition and community in this neighborhood.” There was something so refreshing and touching about that.

The point is, any independent business is rooted in the community around it. The culture and community have to embrace you - they have to feel that you’re important to them - before you can grow and expand. This applies whether you’re a coffee shop, a restaurant, or anything else. So I think it’s important that we support independent businesses because this is where there is an opportunity to build trust between business owners and customers over a long stretch of time.
