## Maison May
270 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11205
Catherine May Saillard owns 2 wonderful establishments in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. She serves a seasonal  menu working closely with local farmers. Her second cafe just opened, Maison May Vanderbilt, serving breakfast and lunch as well as curated objects for the home. I love how she extends her passion for a healthy lifestyle into every ounce of her business and has the utmost respect for every individual she works with.

## Greenlight Bookstore
686 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11217
In the climate of Amazon, it's incredible to see a bookstore that thrives like this. It's always busy and hosts great events with local writers. New York is a super busy city so having an environment where local authors can showcase their work is exceptional. I always find a book there when I'm looking for gifts.

## Dou Yoga
214 Greene Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238
As a regular yoga practitioner I love coming to this space. Dou is a simple studio on the second floor of a brownstone with a beautiful bay window and cherry tree outside. It's run by a great team who are so welcoming and helpful. It provides an environment for the community to come together and be healthy.

## Why is it important to support independent business?
Small businesses run by people who pour their hearts and souls into their work win my support anytime. As a small business owner, I know how hard and challenging it can be so we need to see them survive and thrive. So much innovation can come from this.
