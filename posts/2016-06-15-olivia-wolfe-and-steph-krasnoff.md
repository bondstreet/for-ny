## Grass Roots Juicery

_Olivia_: Grass Roots is owned by one of our closest friends, Sabrina Diaz. I love going to Grass Roots because they offer something that isn’t otherwise available in the neighborhood. They have exactly what I want as far as food and drinks go - it’s an even sweeter deal that it’s a local, independently owned business. 

_Steph_: Since Sabrina’s so involved, she can react really quickly to what the community and her customers want. What’s also great is that the momentum around the business has really picked up, so Sabrina’s been able to expand and build out a retail component in the shop. That’s allowing Juice Press to become a much fuller lifestyle brand, which sets it apart from other spots that might just sell food and drinks.

## Baz Bagels

_Steph_: I met Bari through mutual friends while I was working at Theory. Baz is really important to me because I actually scouted the location for her; she’d told me about the concept and I was like, “amazing, be in our hood!” When the restaurant that was originally there closed, I told Bari to check the spot out and the rest is history. I remember when Baz opened they’d host bingo nights every other week; there’s always a ton of regulars and Bari’s also someone who’s super involved in the community. Good vibes, good food, good people - what’s not to love?

_Olivia_: Plus they have a Two Shot salad on the menu that’s named after us!

## American Two Shot

_Olivia_: This might be a little self-celebratory, but Two Shot is the reason we’re so close to a lot of other local businesses; it’s why we’ve been able to realize how important it is to support people going through the same things we experience. Whether it’s just shouting another spot out in an interview or telling all of your customers to go somewhere, it’s great to be part of that support system and community.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

_Olivia_: My two cents on it is that independent businesses are just better for creativity. 

_Steph_: Yeah, it’s where genuine, not-watered-down creativity lives. We don’t have to go through layers and layers of hierarchy before putting something out in front of our customers. People get excited when they can experience a brand that hasn’t been filtered a billion times. They know they’re getting us.

_Olivia_: You can’t replicate that - people see right through big company initiatives that are designed to mimic what independent businesses do. If you want the benefits of being a local, independent business, you have to be a local, independent business. 

_Steph_: While we’re talking about us here, this is completely applicable to any other independent businesses out there.
