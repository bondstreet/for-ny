## Anna Sheffield's Orchard Street Atelier
Not only is Anna one of the most creative people I know, she is also my big sister and business partner. Eight years older than me and as wise as they come, she’s taught me so much about life, love, creativity, passion, empathy, justice, and vulnerability. She put me on to so much music as a kid, ranging from Nas to The Circle Jerks. She helped me escape the destructive boredom that children growing up in dying southern towns easily fall prey to. The list goes on forever, but the point is that Anna is an incredible human and I am inspired by her every day. Her storefront on Orchard Street is a perfect example of her vision manifested in a physical setting. It showcases everything from her amazing sense of layout and merchandising to her ability to make a space feel personal and intimate.

## Lighthouse
I have been going to Lighthouse for years now - it's right around the corner from my house in Brooklyn. As a former cook who mercilessly judged every diner who made me prepare them chicken, I suddenly find myself ordering chicken nearly every time I’m here. My friend Joey Scalabrino took over as chef fairly recently is largely to blame; his creations are some of the best dishes you can get in the neighborhood, no contest. At only 25 years old, Joey is passionate, full of ideas and driven by the kind of work ethic that separates great artists from good ones. Additionally, the owners of the Lighthouse, a lovely Israeli brother and sister duo, have brought their homeland's influence to Joey’s repertoire while giving him the freedom to bring everything to life in a contemporary way.

## The Meat Hook
As a former butcher and avid meat cook, all I can say is that I love this place so much. I guess I’m almost  genetically programmed to feel this way - both of my grandfathers and my great-grandpa were butchers who owned their own shops. Meat Hook's new location offers its customers a more focused, easy-to-shop selection of aged meats, organic produce, and other brilliantly curated grocery items. I recommend the aged porterhouse, the tomahawk ribeye, their whole aged strip loin, and anything lamb that they have on hand. The staff is super nice and helpful, and most of them have a strong knowledge of meat cookery. This tends to make more adventurous purchases less daunting, as you can gain some insights into how it should be prepared before taking the plunge. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
It's important to support small businesses because they make up the backbone of American creativity and our economy. In order to function as communities, it’s essential that we maintain personal relationships with the companies we do business with. That’s something most large, multinational corporations simply cannot provide in the same capacity.
