## Kalustyan’s
Kalustyan’s is a spot that I’ve been going to since I started working in the city 10 or 11 years ago. It’s the spot that every chef would send their people to to pick some ingredient up last minute. For me, it’s become a spot where I get to tune my life out and dive into what’s always felt like a living encyclopedia. You know their spice shelves? I’ll head straight for them with no specific goal in mind - I’ll just mentally block out a section and learn everything I can about what’s on those racks. My notes from those trips are endless; I’ll scribble them down, head home, and that’s a week’s worth of stuff to study. 

Kalustyan’s evolved and expanded over the last decade and change - both the space and the name are a little bigger now. I think they’re even taking online orders, which is a cool reminder that things are going well for them. Despite all that, the store still maintains its very mom and pop, hole in the wall essence. I love that. Every chef in town has a relationship with Kalustyan’s - it’s the mecca.

## Dover Street Market
DSM is a fairly recent (and, in every possible way, the most unique) addition to the Gramercy / Murray Hill landscape. You don’t think this neighborhood when you think of Dover Street or CdG, and vice versa. I’m the kind of person who wears a lot of basics; I’ll buy maybe one item of clothing a month. But when I do buy clothes, I like to buy pieces that are quality...stuff that will last for a long time. 

I’m also a big fan of Comme des Garcons and their point of view, so it’s exciting to get lost in how they curate offerings from other brands. There’s a parallel between DSM and Kalustyan’s in the sense that they both offer that encyclopedic experience - I learn so much from just walking around both of these places and seeing how they organize and juxtapose things. The top floor at DSM has Supreme and Prada sitting next to each other - this is the only store in the world that could make that pairing work. And I love learning about how they go about accomplishing that.

## The Cannibal
My friend Cory Lane, who was with me at Momofuku, is one of the owners of The Cannibal. I actually came by The Cannibal the first few times without knowing Cory was involved - one day, I saw him and it was one of those -  “what the hell are you doing here?” “wait, what the hell are YOU doing here?” situations. He then tells me he owns the place and I’m like, shit! 

So The Cannibal is all about head-to-toe cooking - that’s when they use every aspect of the animal. Little to nothing gets wasted. I’m a big fan of that approach. The best thing about these guy is that they take risks - everything is bold. Some choices pay off better than others, but Francis Derby is an incredibly talented chef who makes it work. I mean, bone marrow brulee - what an iconic dish. 

To continue the theme of encyclopedic experiences - I’d definitely say that The Cannibal’s beer selection is extremely underrated. You can find some weird, super niche stuff that you’d never even come across at the best bars or pubs in the city. They’re hunting all the time and really keeping the curation tight - some beers they’ll have, say, a dozen bottles of and then you won’t see that brand again for another four months. More people need to check that beer selection out.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I don’t have a really philosophical answer for this...my answer is that I just wouldn’t want every business in my neighborhood or city to be the same. I’d never want to live somewhere that’s all Wal-Marts and Burger Kings. You can’t learn anything from places like that. You want that individuality in businesses you frequent because that means there’s a personal interaction to be had with the people who own it. When I’m at Kalustyan’s, the people who work there will always ask me if I’ve tried this thing they just got in last week. Same thing with my friends who work at Dover Street. They put me onto stuff and help me push my own boundaries. 

The most important thing is that there’s a balance between the big and little guys. No knock to Wal-Mart - I’m Korean. I love a good deal. I’ll go nuts in a Wal-Mart. But what I’m saying is that you don’t want it all to tip one way or the other. There has to be a healthy balance. That’s what makes a community thrive.
