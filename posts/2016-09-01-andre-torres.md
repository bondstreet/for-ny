## A&A Bake & Doubles Shop
I’ve been coming to A&A for a few years after getting turned onto it by LargeUp.com founder Jesse Serwer. At the time, I didn’t even know what doubles were but he swore A&A was the best in Brooklyn. It’s an odd “sandwich” of curried chickpeas inside fried bread, with tamarind, apple, and mango sauces, and hot pepper. I’ve never bothered comparing because once I had A&A, I couldn’t imagine anyone doing it better. I always hit it on the earlier side of lunch, because it’s not uncommon to roll through in the afternoon and find all the doubles already sold out. I’ve come to understand that’s because it’s traditionally eaten for breakfast in Trinidad. The owner, Geeta Brown, is sweet but all about her bidness since they do such crazy volume. For me, A&A is the quintessential small business. They’ve cornered the niche with high quality product and service, and I’ll be eating those doubles as long as they’re serving.

## Al's Men Shop
I’m a hat guy; it’s a rare occasion that I’m not wearing one. But I’m not so much a fitted kinda dude as much as a wide-brimmed fedora kinda dude. I stumbled on Al’s because they were next door to a Goodwill that always had a gang of vinyl. That Goodwill was torn down a few months ago, but Al’s is still going strong after over fifty years in business. They’ve got an insane range of hats from Kangol to Bailey, and I can imagine Al’s being a fave among pimps back in the day. I’ve brought everyone from young bucks to my pops here, so Al’s is on point no matter what you’re looking for. I’m always impressed how the guys there can tell your size by just by looking at your head. Styles have come and gone, but Al’s is forever.

## Charlie’s Calypso City
Charlie’s has been around for over forty years, and from the looks of it they haven’t changed a thing. The old-school sign out front and steady stock of vintage vinyl makes it feel like you’re stepping into a time machine. While you’re not going to find a copy of that rare funk record you’ve been looking for, you’ll come up on a dope ’80’s dancehall 12” you’ve never seen before. That’s the type of music discovery you can’t get from an algorithm. Charlie’s also houses a recording studio upstairs, and has given lots of local artists their first shot. A real staple of the community, it’s the kind of spot you take for granted and assume will be there forever. But I always remind myself that I thought that same thing about dozens of other joints that have fallen by the wayside in our disappearing New York. Places like Charlie’s are the reason I moved to Brooklyn in the first place, that’s why I cherish them now and support as much as I can. I’d hate to see all of that history erased just because some idiot developer thinks we need another overpriced condo in the hood.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Independent business is the cornerstone of our economy. No matter how large a company gets, it all starts locally with the mom and pop spot. Nike and Apple may be billion dollar multinationals, but they both started in small garages with big dreams. After running my own company for fifteen years, I empathize with other indie business owners—especially black business owners. I know their struggle first hand, so I appreciate the spots that can weather the storm and consistently deliver the goods. I’m always amazed when I see a small indie business that’s been around for decades still going strong. America’s tried to convince everyone that you’re nothing unless you’re bigger and better than the next guy, but I like indie businesses that know their lane and stay in it. They’re content just doing what they love, and serve as a constant and humbling reminder of why I’m on this planet in the first place.
