## Dimes

I’ve known the Dimes girls for a long time - we met before the restaurant existed, actually, and they were working elsewhere. Having watched Sabrina and Alissa work so hard to get Dimes off the ground, I can’t help but respect how much they put into making it real. They started small but have steadily taken over a couple of larger spaces on the block - it’s been awesome to watch them grow and add new dimensions to what Dimes is. I’m there practically every day.

## Metrograph

I’ve been a big film buff since I was a kid, and it’s hard to find a theater (let alone an independent one) with curation that’s more spot-on than Metrograph’s. There’s a super obscure animated film that floated around Japan when I was a kid called The Belladonna of Sadness. I’d heard about it as it made its way through the underground, but I never managed to catch it during those years. It speaks to how great Metrograph is that I was finally able to watch the film in the LES in 2016.

## Mast Books

In a time when stores that deal with tangible products are closing faster than ever, it’s really impressive that Mast Books continues to thrive. Like Metrograph, I think Mast’s secret weapon is their really unbelievable curation. You can always find something that you didn’t know about when you visit the shop. I also respect how they emphasize the visual quality of books as objects in their presentation.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

It’s about variety, right? Variety’s basically how we survive from an evolutionary perspective - the more variation you have, the stronger a species is. The same principle applies to culture and cities; the more homogenous they are, the weaker they become. To me, independent businesses really bring that variety, that strength, to cities. There’s a parallel there for sure.
