## Hot Bread Kitchen
So we’re in Harlem at HBK - Hot Bread Kitchen - which was started by an amazing woman named Jessamyn Rodriguez. It’s a two-pronged business - the first is educating refugees, all women, on how to learn skillsets in the kitchen (especially making bread). It’s a really amazing program that empowers people to not only learn new skills but go out into the market and build viable careers off of them. The second part of her company is helping small business accelerate, mainly through access to kitchen space. Kitchen space is really expensive in New York, especially for small businesses when you just need some pots, pans, and a stove. Jessamyn provides that infrastructure at a subsidized rate for community members in Harlem. HBK is close to the heart for me and my partners because we actually started Hella out of their facility in 2012. They solved our problem of not being able to access capital for infrastructure - had we used the capital we had for product on infrastructure, it would have been a wrap for us. HBK gave us exactly what we needed to get off the ground.

## ABC Cocina
ABC Cocina is where we have all of our celebrations whenever we hit a milestone. It’s where we take clients when something amazing happens...it’s just an incredible hospitality space. We love having a relationship w the ABC guys because they represent the standard of quality and hospitality that we aspire to with Hella. Getting them as a partner was a big stamp of approval, a really significant cosign, for us. They’re the shit when it comes to food, design, again, hospitality, and just thinking about how the whole experience needs to come together. Definitely one of my favorite accounts.

## Story Store
Story Store is an incredible spot created by a brilliant woman named Rachel Shechtman. The idea behind Story is that it’s run like a magazine - the theme behind the store changes up every 8 to 12 weeks. So one week, you might have a story that’s all about yoga or wellness, whereas right now the whole thing is built out to promote the show Mr. Robot. Everything that’s sold in the store during that window will somehow reflect the theme. For us, Story and Rachel have been great because they’ll let us get involved from an events standpoint, where we’ll run the bar for her, and from a retail perspective if the theme is relevant to Hella. We spend a lot of time there building relationships through Rachel - for example, she’s one of the primary reasons we were featured in the American Express commercial. We met the team at one of her events. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Supporting independent businesses is crucial because most businesses in the world are small and independent. Without small businesses, you don’t have the United States of America. You don’t have today’s economy. You don’t have people with jobs - the majority of people who are employed today work for small businesses. Even big businesses acquire small businesses to keep growing - so nothing that we do can exist without that initial inspiration, that motivation of individuals coming together to start independent businesses. The ecosystem just doesn’t work - it can’t sustain or balance itself - unless you support small, independent businesses.
