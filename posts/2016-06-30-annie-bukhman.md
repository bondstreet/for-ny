## Purity Diner

Oh I love a good diner! I always get either one of two things -  2 eggs, rye toast, and home fries; or a tuna melt (soooo amazing) and of course countless refills of coffee. Purity is so cozy and friendly and there’s always a comfy booth available. I think pretty much everyone who knows me has joined me at Purity at one time or another. I go every chance I get. I've had business meetings, design meetings (yes I had my line plan and design sheets scattered all over the table), I even had my 35th birthday here. My birthday is in December so going out on a freezing cold night at my age sounds sort of terrible terrible, so I invited my girlfriends in the neighborhood for a Purity breakfast. The waitresses overheard it was my bday and when we were done with breakfast they brought over a mini stack of chocolate chip pancakes with whipped cream and a candle and sang happy birthday.

## Tarzian West 

Small, but chock full of everything kitchen and bath. I shop Tarzian for shower curtains, spatulas, wine glasses;  I've also purchased many gifts there. They have a great selection of interesting and unique little dishes and kitchen specialties. I always find something new, and even though it’s such a small shop they somehow always have what I'm looking for. I love that their selection of goods is also well edited, I think it helps customers make better / more intentional purchases.  There's also always someone right there when you need them to answer a question, or help you find something (or just to help you carry all those wine glasses to the register).

## Back to the Land

I think the people who love to shop small, local, and handmade for material items, are generally the same people that take great consideration regarding what they put into their bodies as well.  It was a slow transition for me, but I am finally at a point now where I'm sort of terrified of conventional produce, I will only buy organic. I love Back to the Land because although it’s a small shop, they have a great selection of produce; and I know I can go in and grab any piece of fruit or vegetable and it will be organic. Honestly, every time I go to Wholefoods I have trouble finding organic produce, or it’s completely sold out; it’s so frustrating and a waste of time searching high and low for the organic.  Back to the Land also has an amazing selection of teas; lotions and body products; as well as vitamins and supplements. The employees are always very friendly, helpful and knowledgable. I pretty much grocery shop there exclusively, I'm there 3 or 4 times a week, definitely a favorite!

## Why is it important to support independent business?

Even before I started my own small business I always supported and favored small businesses to large mass market corporations. Small businesses can't afford to carry every product under the sun so they are forced to either supply a niche, or a very curated selection or offering - aka only the best, no fillers. I love going around to my neighborhood favorites and getting the best cheese here, and the best tomatoes there. The products or services small businesses offer are thought out, valued, and more personal. Small businesses provide the feeling that a real person is behind it all, someone who cares more about giving us a quality product or service, over just taking our hard earned dollars.
