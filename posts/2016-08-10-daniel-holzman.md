## Bamonte's 
Over 100 years old and still owned by the same family, selling the same menu to the same regulars (or at least they look that old) - Bamonte’s is the stuff of pure legends. I first stumbled in here 10 years ago and couldn’t believe the scene; what bar is complete without telephone booths, a cigarette vending machine, and a handful nefarious-looking characters nursing drinks. Make a reservation or just walk in - there’s always a table or a spot at the bar. Get yourself a martini, some baked clams, the Spicy Calamari and the Veal Rollatini. You can thank me later.

## Mikey’s Hook-Up 
Just saying, if you need to get your computer fixed…. Mikey’s has been doing their thing since before Williamsburg was a thing. If you’re in the market for an old school amp, guitar cables, miscellaneous computer parts, or printer ink, then look no further. We get all of our laptops from The Meatball Shop repaired at Mikey’s - they do a bang up job for a fair price on a tight timeline. There’s also a ping pong table right in the middle of the store.

## Rush Designs  
Need that prototype for the latest invention you just dreamed up? CNC milling? 3D printing? Electric engineering of any kind? If you can imagine it, the guys at Rush can build it and you’ll have a good time watching while they do what they do best. Not too many places where you can pop in off the street with a drawing on a napkin and turn that into something real. These are a bunch of super cool nerds making people’s dreams come to life. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Growing up in NYC, you take the city for granted - but as soon as you leave it’s easy to see what makes this place so special.  There’s a sense of discovery here that simply doesn’t exist anywhere else; every block is another unique adventure waiting to be found. And what keeps that dream alive? It’s all those small businesses lining the streets, inviting you to investigate their distinct perspectives. Drive across America and you’ll find the same mall selling the same things to the same people in every town you stop through; but then there’s NYC: a different place boasting a different point of view for a melting pot of different people each sporting their individual styles. For every big chain out there, there was a small business at its inception. This is the foundation of the American Dream; the true core of democracy. You vote with your dollars - and every single vote counts - so I vote diligently and give my dollars to the businesses that deserve them.
