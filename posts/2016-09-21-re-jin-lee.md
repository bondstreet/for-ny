## Home of the Brave 
A few years ago, I met the owners (wife & husband team) during a tradeshow; since then they've been great supporters of my work. They've created a wonderful space, with an attention to detail I truly appreciate (the floors!) and a beautiful selection of home goods. I admire their aesthetic and strong support for local makers. We often run into each other with our families as we work and live in the same neighborhood.

## Franklin Pizza 
I'm so grateful this one is close to my studio. The friendly staff serves straightforward, no frills, good pizza. The dough is spot on, in my opinion. Though I enjoy the fancy thin crusted pizzas once in a while, there's nothing like a normal, down to earth slice of pizza.

## Brooklyn Barge
We have an amazing view of the East River and Manhattan from my studio window. One thing I appreciate the most is the breeze that keeps us refreshed during warm days and with it the scent of salt water that reminds me of the beach life growing up in Brazil. That leads me to going down to the Barge (which is right next door) as it reminds me of the food & drinks "quiosques" (kiosks in Portuguese) on the Brazilian beaches. There's nothing more comforting to me than the smell of food (especially fried) and freshly squeezed lime mixed in with the scent of salt water. The river is no beach, and the barge is not a 'quiosque', of course, but I appreciate it as what it is; a great local place to enjoy a drink, the breeze and a good conversation whilst floating on water and looking out into the beautiful NYC skyline.

## Why is it important so support independent businesses?
From an independent business you will receive the fruit of their passion. They share with you a little piece of their dream. It's tough to keep a small business up and running, especially in NYC; so you know that that small business is working intensely hard to provide you with only the good stuff. Additionally, by supporting one independent business, you are also supporting an entire network of small businesses that helped them make it happen.
