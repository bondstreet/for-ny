## Hotoveli
Hotoveli has two locations - one on Bleecker and another on West 4th - I’ve shopped at the latter since it first opened. They’ve got this smoky, glass facade that gives the space a unique look and everyone who works there is really knowledgeable. The guy who owns Hotoveli is just fantastic. Most importantly, they’ve got this assortment of cutting-edge clothing that’s just impeccably curated. Just last week, I bought this brilliant, techy jacket from a cult brand in Germany called Acronym for my son. He was so psyched. I mean, you really have to dig around to find this kind of stuff anywhere else. I love that I can always walk by, pop my head in, and know that I’ll find something exciting and new.  

## Perla
I love all of Gabe Stulman’s restaurants - obviously, for the sake of transparency, I’m an investor in all of them. I met Gabe years ago when he opened Little Owl, and if you go back and read my post about that meeting, I said, “this guy is the next Danny Meyer.” He runs a front room like no other, he’s charming, he’s wonderful, and you just want to sit down and have a beer with him. When he left, I ran into him and asked him what he was up to. He said he’d just opened up a new place called Joseph Leonard and I said, “I’m totally investing in you.” My husband went, “are you kidding?” and I said absolutely not. This is a great thing to invest in because it’ll better the neighborhood. It’s great for the community, it’s great for Gabe, it’s great for everyone involved. Will we make money on it like we do with a tech company? No. But the truth is, we’ve made all our money back and then some with Joseph Leonard in just three years. It’s a win all around.

## Grove Drugs
Grove Drugs - I love a local pharmacy. It’s just the nicest group of women that runs this place. They’ve got a great selection of products from all over - from sunblocks to mints to shampoo. You go in there and you’re just taken care of. Whether you’re picking up a prescription or shopping for whatever else you need, you don’t have to deal with any of the insanity that you get at a CVS or a Duane Reade. It’s great and right down the block from me.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
It’s important to support local businesses so we can continue to have authentic, interesting neighborhoods that foster community amongst its inhabitants. It kind of goes back to what this Presidential election is about - American businesses have grown and taken over the globe, but they’re struggling to survive because the next generation believes in the value of more focused, personal brands and that less is best. I do believe that’s why we’re seeing these big businesses become unsustainable - Abercrombie? Poof. Ralph Lauren? Firing people left and right. The fact is, America was built on family businesses and I like that there’s a shift towards those values again.
