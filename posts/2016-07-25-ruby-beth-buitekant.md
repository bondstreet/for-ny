## Corner Grind
Corner Grind is home. It's black owned coffee shop. With coffee shops being a rapid symbol and indicator of gentrification all around New York (but especially in historically black neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy), it's really important to me that I support black-owned businesses. Corner Grind is a really easy place to be in and it welcomes a wide range of people. Fancy coffee when it’s 90 in Brooklyn and all you need is an iced something? yes. But let’s not forget the burgers, salads, breakfast burritos, either: nourishment that tastes incredible. All in all, Corner is surprisingly chill for a Brooklyn coffee spot.

## Bedford Hall
Bedford Hall makes me feel good. It's lined with old books, globes, armchairs, and has quite the decor going on. More importantly, however, it’s also friendly, welcoming, and a great place to grab a drink. I used to go out a lot more but am finding myself slowing down as 30 is approaching, so it's nice to have local bars that feel a little grown. They always have tons of events like burlesque, trivia and live music, so going to Bedford usually turns your night into a whole different experience than you planned to have. It's fun.

## dimple + dot
dimple + dot is the future. I'm so skeptical of the skin products that are pushed on me. The more we understand how the cosmetics and beauty industries prey on our insecurities, the more important it becomes to know exactly what is in the products you are using on your body. Savannah Leone is so concise and transparent in how she explains the composition of her products - you can really see how much care she applies to her craft. We all have such similar needs when it comes to skin; why not use products that make us feel safe? 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
As a non-native New Yorker, I'm very aware of how my presence as a new resident affects the neighborhoods where I live. Gentrification is complicated, but people getting pushed out of their homes because they can't afford to live in their neighborhoods any more is not. It's just bad. It's a reality that’s affecting Brooklyn in a huge way right now and all new residents have to figure out what our role is in that dynamic. For me, choosing where I spend my money is a big part of that. I want to support businesses that support their neighborhoods. Supporting black-owned businesses feels like a way of articulating my politics in my daily life. So long as we are still participating in capitalism, I want to do it in ways that feel good for my life. I love Central Brooklyn and I want my actions to prove it day in and day out.
