## Picture Room and Goods for the Study
My shops, Picture Room and Goods for the Study, are both under the McNally Jackson umbrella. I spend pretty much all of my time at both because they’re the best! Sarah McNally and I decided to open Goods for the Study three years ago - it was a very organic idea that came about because we’d found so many great stationery items that weren’t being presented in the right context. We wanted to have a place that supported the idea of what a creative workplace is and could be. 

As we were looking for vintage prints for Goods for the Study, we realized that there was a much larger concept we could build around affordable art. So we opened Picture Room next door a year later; it’s a comfortable venue for people to check out and buy high quality pieces that you’d otherwise have to go out of your way to find. 

Working out of a place that completely reflects my point of view and aesthetic choices has been such an enriching experience for me. I’m lucky to be able to do this every day and immerse myself in what I love.

## Fiat Cafe
Fiat is right around the corner from Picture Room and Goods for the Study - I go there all the time because it’s kind of the definitive coffee spot in the neighborhood. It’s super comfortable, they’ve got great food, it’s kid-friendly, the owners and staff are all wonderful people, and you always see people you know. 

Sarah [McNally] and I go there a lot, but I don’t know if the bookstore guys do. It’s definitely not the fastest place by any means - it’s more a meeting spot or somewhere to hang out after work (or if you’ve got the afternoon to yourself).

## Tu-Lu’s Gluten Free Bakery
Tu-Lu’s is the best place for gluten-free cupcakes, cakes, and everything else in New York. Weirdly, I don’t think too many people know about it, despite (well, maybe because of) the fact that it’s next door to Veniero’s. Right in the heart of the East Village. I used to live right around here, so I’d be at Tu-Lu’s maybe once a day. Now that I live further out, whenever my family and I drive into Manhattan on the weekends, we’ll stop by Tu-Lu’s to buy Celiac-friendly things by the box. My kids have their demands, of course, but mostly it’s about my needs - specifically, my ceaseless need for a chocolate cupcake (laughs).   

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Unless you’re a soulless Trump supporter, you want to shop and live near places that actually mean things to people; places that have a real effect on communities. You can feel when someone really cares about the neighborhood they’re running a business in. It’s the difference between a small clothing shop that takes the time to think out every detail and interaction with its customers versus the assembly-line, cattle-herding experience of an H&M. 

I’d also note that transparency is another quality of independent businesses that tends to not happen at mass market scales - if you really care about where things come from and how they’re obtained, you’ll get a much more honest answer about that when you can talk to the owner of a business face to face.
