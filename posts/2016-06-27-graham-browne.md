## Ultima Florals

Ultima, the neighborhood florist, keeps my apartment bright and my family and friends happy. I can always count on having quality conversations with the staff and anyone who happens to be in the store. It's a very positive vibe over there.

## Headz Ain't Ready

Headz Ain’t Ready is a barbershop in the neighborhood. It was actually the first store I visited when I moved here and I've gone back for my haircuts ever since. Everyone on the team at Headz pays an incredible amount of attention to detail - all of the barbers treat every cut like it’s a work of art. The collages and murals on the wall, depicting: Nas, Jay-Z, Big Pun, Scarface, Goodfellas, the Godfather, and even the 7 train completely sets them apart.

## Arunee Thai

I struggle with this: do I tell everyone how good this place is or do I tell no one? I thought that I knew what good Thai food was until I stepped into Arunee for the first time. The curries are so rich and flavorful and their duck dishes are absolutely unmatched. Oh, and did I mention that they deliver to my apartment in less than fifteen minutes?

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
It is important to support independent businesses because independent businesses define my neighborhood. They’re responsible for bringing and maintaining the personality, culture, and flavors that make Jackson Heights what it is. I can't imagine my neighborhood without them.
