## Pilgrim Surf + Supply
Pilgrim is owned by two friends of mine; they’ve become a real community hub for the neighborhood. There’s something at the store for anyone who likes surfing, fishing, hiking - really any New Yorker who kind of has one foot in that outdoor lifestyle. Pilgrim took off because they were able to curate an amazing selection of brands and items that you can’t find anywhere else within this very considered, thoughtfully designed space. They hit the mark so hard, actually, that everyone else just ended up boosting their style. You had minivans from every corporation out front for a while, you know, sending their people inside to figure out what they could boost and apply to their own retail. 

So, instead of being too pissy about it, the Pilgrim guys just pushed themselves to take the next step, which was to design their own clothing line. They don’t go about doing that half-assed, either. The line is very focused on using sustainable or recyclable materials, it’s made in Japan (where they also opened up a store), and...you know, right now, it’s expensive to manufacture that way, but these are quality pieces that are extremely durable and will last for a long time. It’s the opposite of the waste you see going on in fast fashion. There are definitely similarities to what Patagonia was doing early on. 

I won’t go to a brick and mortar anymore unless I really feel like I’m getting an actual experience out of it. Pilgrim always delivers on that.

## Spoonbill & Sugartown
I’m a book hoarder. I own way too many books. So it goes without saying that I love Spoonbill, which has been in the neighborhood for almost two decades now. They’re about to get priced out of Bedford thanks to the crazy rent hikes going on in Williamsburg, which is really tragic because it’s become such a staple in the community. The good news is, Spoonbill was smart enough to see the writing on the wall - they opened a warehouse in Bushwick a few years ago, so they’ll be moving the retail operation to that location, as well. 

There’s a smell that’s unique to small bookstores - coming from Europe, that smell always reminds me of the architectural book store my dad would take me to when I was a kid. You know, you’d have the owner smoking cigarettes inside with two cats sitting on top of everything. It’s ridiculous, but there’s a vibe and energy that you get in spaces like these that you simply cannot replicate in big chains. A bookstore should feel alive. Spoonbill feels that way for me. 

Williamsburg has obviously changed a lot, but it’s still a very artist-driven neighborhood. So whenever you have someone who’s moving out of town and can’t be bothered to take his books with him, or someone who’s cleaning her studio out, these people will all bring their collections to Spoonbill. Whenever that happens, I’m down there doing what’s basically the bookstore equivalent of digging for records. The guys know me well enough now that they’ll let me go through stuff that hasn’t been marked for sale yet. It speaks to how essential Spoonbill is to the community that Kim Gordon will just bring over 20 copies of her autobiography, signed, or that KAWS will come in and sign his book for them because he knows it’ll up the sale value. When we do a new issue of VICTORY, we’ll just drop a box off at the store off the strength. These guys are super important to all of us.

## Samurai Mama
I love what the owners of this place are doing, both here and at their other restaurants, Bozu and Papa Samurai. I like the fact that it’s not just cliche, American adaptations of sushi and bento boxes. They’ve really keyed into authentic Japanese comfort food, whether it’s sushi, udon, ramen, or other dishes like their homemade ravioli. It feels like a real izakaya that you might find yourself at in Tokyo. Or someone’s kitchen at home. A lot of people pass by on their way to other spots, and it’s like, man...you have no idea what you’re missing! 

I have kids so I don’t really go out too much anymore, but this is a great place to take the family for dinner or just for me to stop by alone during lunch. My kids are always asking to come here. If you come by during off hours, it’s really mellow, but after 8 it’s absolutely crazy packed. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses
Well, first and foremost, I grew up with parents who were small business owners. They made scale models for architects and worked together for 46 years. My mom had an internship with Le Corbusier, met my dad while they were both getting their master’s, fell in love, and decided to start this business (which didn’t really exist at the time) up. 46 years! I learned from them what it means to be independent...what self-determination means. My dad would always tell me to go buy groceries or whatever at the local shop, not the big chain, because the former was run by a guy like him who had kids like me. So I really associated independence with family from an early age, as well.

Now, because so much of our lives are online, the physical experience of interacting with a business feels a lot more emotional to me. You can feel things, you can smell them - the immediacy of that tactile experience is really valuable. So that plays into how we operate Doubleday, too, you know? We’ll work with big corporate accounts that can singlehandedly keep the lights on in our office, but we’ll also make sure to turn around and do pro bono work for small businesses that we believe in. It’s really essential that we contribute to maintaining that balance.
