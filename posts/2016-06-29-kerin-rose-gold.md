## B&Q Trimmings

I’m the founder and designer of A-Morir eyewear, an artist, and a costumer - it goes without saying that a store like B&Q is absolutely vital to my work. They have a seemingly endless supply of stuff that I can draw upon for inspiration and flex my creative muscle with. Over the eight or nine years that I’ve been a customer there, I’ve managed to become great friends with Peter, the owner. We understand each other because we both live the experience of running your own business. Having that in common is invaluable; Peter has been extremely generous with me whenever I need to source very specific materials for a piece - he even goes so far as to discount items if he knows I’m working on a tight client budget. In turn, I’ll never go anywhere else - I’m extremely loyal to and supportive of B&Q.

## Angelica Kitchen

Angelica Kitchen is an organic, vegan restaurant that I think is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year - it’s a New York City institution. I grew up in a very health-conscious household; it was always really important to my parents that they were feeding their children good food. As such, we’ve been coming to Angelica as a family since I was seven (I’m 33 now, for perspective). I think they’re one of the few businesses that are still around from that era because they’ve been able to adapt without losing the core of...well, the integrity that makes them wonderful. The food is absolutely wonderful and everyone who works there is unbelievably kind (but not in the hippy-dippy way LA is...which usually just makes me want to punch people in the face). There’s a strong community of regulars at Angelica that ensures it continues to thrive.

## Trash and Vaudeville

As a little punk kid growing up in the suburbs, it was a real tragedy that the most unique clothes I had access to were at The Gap. Trash and Vaudeville has always been a punk rock, counterculture clothing beacon. They were on St. Mark’s for about 30 years when St. Mark’s was still St. Mark’s. I’ll always remember being sixteen years old, walking by Trash and seeing Joey Ramone outside. That’s what it was all about; that’s what it represented. Trash was awesome because it felt more like a place for punks to hang out together as opposed to a business, really. Everyone would post up and you’d be able to find out about upcoming shows, new bands, and all of that. Today, St. Mark’s feels more like a food court in a mall than the epicenter of punk that it used to be. Due to the corresponding rent hikes that come with a transformation like that, Trash is now over on 7th between 1st and A. Today was my first time going by the new location; I’m stoked that it still retains and reflects all of the original spot’s energy.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Even before I was an independent business owner, I always worked at smaller companies and I always preferred supporting them. There’s something special about knowing that someone created this thing to uplift other people in the community - I really believe that’s what independent businesses ultimately do. An independent business will hire someone who a big company might unfairly pass on. Independent businesses build community and culture. We set trends that large corporations ultimately end up vulturing; you can observe that dynamic in everything from food to fashion to finance. If you live in New York, almost every part of your life is somehow affected by small businesses - if you don’t support them, it’s your fault when they disappear and the world becomes a hellscape of Starbucks, H&M’s, and CVS’s.
