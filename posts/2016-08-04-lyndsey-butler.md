## Karma
Karma is new to the Lower East Side, but it’s already proven to be the perfect addition to our neighborhood. Considering how many galleries have opened up around here in the past few years, it only makes sense to have one that sells beautifully curated art books as well. Now all we need an independent literary bookstore in the neighborhood and we’re set. While we wait for that to happen, the Seward Park Library is always a good place to stop into if you’re looking for something new to read.

## Metrograph
I am completely obsessed with Metrograph. The design and aesthetic choices throughout the theater are perfect. The programming is as thoughtful as it is fun. The food and drinks in the commissary (which recently opened up on the mezzanine) are elevated without being too fussy.
 
I often come to Metrograph solo for "treat yourself to something nice" nights. That said, my fiancé and I watch a lot of movies so it also happens to be the perfect date spot for us. I’ve also been by for work meetings or just to hang out and catch up with friends. It’s really a great venue for all occasions, whether you’re watching a movie or not!

## Dimes Market
I love everything about the Dimes universe, which is steadily growing and expanding right here on the east end of Canal. They have such great taste that really comes through in how they execute on food, drinks, design, style choices, etc. Dimes Market is an awesome addition to the whole experience - I actually find myself going there more often than the restaurants themselves now. They’ll always have the few exact items I’ll need to pick up without the overwhelming, often gratuitous range of options you’ll find at supermarkets. Having Market around has made me start cooking more. 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I’m a small business owner who comes from a family of small business owners, so I understand and respect the amount of hard work, commitment, vision, and love that goes into operating your own business. If you’re an independent business owner yourself, you know exactly what I’m referring to - it kind of goes without saying that we should be supporting each other. To dive a little deeper, I’d say that by supporting independent businesses, we also cultivate and encourage diversity in our neighborhoods and communities. This is because independent businesses create and offer choice. 

You have to be be vigilant about supporting neighborhood establishments you love, especially if you want them to remain a part of the community. It’s depressing when I go home to Texas and drive past countless, identical shopping centers just a few miles apart from each other. Every single one has the same lineup of chain restaurants, a Walmart, a Home Depot, and a drive-thru Starbucks. That homogeneity really makes me appreciate the diversity, personalities, and support system of independent business in downtown NYC even more. Maybe it's easier for us to maintain these values because we are a comparatively small and condensed community (meaning you get to know the owners and the employees quicker), but that energy and camaraderie is something we can’t take for granted. We really have to protect that.
