## Silver Moon Bakery

Though it takes up just a thumbprint of the block, Silver Moon's chocolate-chocolate chip cookies are bigger than our apartment. And, honestly, probably more worth the price.

## Absolute Bagels

As New Yorkers, as Jews, as longtime breakfast aficionados, we take our bagels very seriously. So we mean it when we say the absolute best bagels in New York City are made by a Thai family on the Upper West Side. And it's not just us who think so: every weekend, lines wrap around the block. You'd think they were dropping video games or Nikes.

## Westside Market

We love our local grocery store for the proximity to our apartment, the limitless options of hot, cold, prepackaged and made-to-order options, and especially for the personal service from people like the manager Homer, who is always excited to catch up and talk about this week's guest on our podcast. Also, it's 24 hours.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

The stereotype of the Upper West Side is that it's a dead zone of banks, frozen yogurt shops and the occasional Starbucks. But there are pockets of personality, whether it's the toy store West Side Kids or Grand Metro Housewares. We support them because we love being surprised.
