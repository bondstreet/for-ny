## The Shala

We practice yoga daily and everywhere, but this is the only studio that both of us practice at together. SK started practicing yoga 4-5 years ago - he used to make fun of me for practicing but then realized it’s a really good thing for him. So he got into it and then found this studio and I started going with him so we could spend more time together. It’s great to be able to do that regularly.

## Telegraphe Cafe

Originally, we started going to Telegraphe because it’s basically across the street from our Chelsea store. Their coffee is awesome and their sandwiches are great. Additionally, the fact that it’s just a husband and wife team running the operation really resonated with us, because that’s how we run BoConcept. They’re also transplants like us - both of them come from France. They never give us free coffee, but I guess it’s not like we give them free furniture!

## BoConcept

It’s the best store in the world! Just kidding. We have two children, but we definitely look at BoConcept like it’s our first kid. We love it - it’s how we’ve made our living and how our family is able to grow and thrive. It’s all because of this.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

To us, it’s important to support independent businesses because we’re an independent business; simple as that. Local businesses in a big city like New York are essential because, without them, we’re a giant Mall of America - we’re Times Square everywhere. What independent businesses offer both people who live here and visitors is so distinct from what you might find through big boxes and corporations - it’s an authentic, curated view into the personality of whoever owns it.
