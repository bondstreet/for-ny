## The Bowery Market
The Bowery Market offers all sorts of delicious fare and the pop-up / outdoor environment makes it an easy, perfect summer spot. You can satisfy your cravings for sushi, tacos, sandwiches and delicious healthy food all in one place. The tacos and fruit pops at Pulqueria are beyond yummy. I've now tried the fish tacos and the steak tacos and I can say they are some of the best I've ever had - not just in NYC, I really mean ever! The bright color treatments on all of the shipping containers and the super cool people who work there may add to the whole experience, but damn if those tacos aren't addictive.

## The Smile
The Smile is my favorite lunch spot in the hood. The food is always delicious here and the menu has a lot of healthy options that manage to be super satisfying. As someone with a real sweet tooth, I always appreciate that The Smile has a solid dessert selection, but I always find myself opting for the chocolate chip & sea salt cookies - I just love them so much. Carlos and Matt have done a great job of making The Smile a comfortable yet cool restaurant; it’s plain to see why it’s become the local institution that it is.

## Gasoline Alley Coffee
The Gasoline guys make a mean cup of coffee that never fails to keep my brain on point. The staff members are always so nice and accommodating - they’re always willing to point you to other options in their great selection of other drinks (caffeinated and non-caffeinated alike). Gasoline also has a nice assortment of pastries that make perfect snacks for pairing with your coffee while on the go. The super airy and bright space with entrances and massive windows on both sides is lovely year-round.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
I love supporting my local neighborhood businesses. As a small business owner myself, I understand the struggle and hardships as well as the strength and conviction needed to make an independent business work. It's a hustle all day everyday; I have the utmost respect for all the hustlers out there. Small businesses help improve their environments by bringing fresh concepts and ideas to a neighborhood, which is critical in keeping things interesting and inspiring for people who make up the community. While it’s tough, New York offers the possibility for someone to start any kind of small business imaginable, which is what makes this city is so special and unique.
