## Hudson Market Place

If you live in New York your corner store is incredibly important to you. Those guys are practically in your family if you’re a real New Yorker. They see everyone you bring in and out of your house and every condition you’ve been in, whether you’re tired and feel like shit or you look great heading somewhere. I support my guys because they work all hours seven days a week and go through a lot to live in New York - all while sending money back home to their families. On top of that, they have to work for their dad who probably yells at them nonstop every day even though they’re adults. So, they deserve the support!

## Stile’s Farmers Market

Grocery shopping in New York is sort of bullshit. You have to go to eight different places to find meat, produce, and whatever else unless you’re willing to pay for crazy markups at Whole Foods or wherever. I support Stile’s because they never overcharge you, the same crew is always there, and everyone clearly works really hard. Regular, normally priced vegetables - what a concept. I can fill up my fridge with fruits and vegetables from Stile’s for like $17 to $24. That said, I totally thought Stile’s was a giant dumpster in a sort of abandoned parking lot the first few times I walked past it.

## Broadway Dance

I like Broadway Dance because you don’t have to commit - you can just drop in and take a class whenever you feel like it. I’ve been going there since I first moved to New York - the membership is like $20 a year. Where else can you get vogue classes from actual voguers, house classes from actual old house heads...I think there’s even a club class where you can wear heels. True New York shit. There’s a really sick dancehall class that is the hardest thing you’ll ever do.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Because they keep your city alive. Independent business owners care about you and you should care about them. Staying local is almost always better for your city. You don’t get real interactions with anyone when you go to a big chain store or restaurant - I feel like that can easily trickle down to how neighbors and people who live in a community talk to each other. Also, everyone our age is starting to realize that you should be working for yourself and not some middle management asshole who doesn’t care about you. So if we’re all trying to start our own businesses, it’s even more important that we look out for each other.
