## AYR
My friends Jac Cameron and Maggie Winter launched AYR in 2014. A trip to their Studioshop on Broadway and Bond is like going shopping with your best friend - if your best friend is Phoebe Philo and everything you try on brings out your inner it-girl. Their team will pull things that are unexpected, yet somehow perfect for you.

AYR stands for “All Year Round” and breaks from traditional fashion by creating pieces that are seasonless. Everything they make is refined, clean, effortlessly cool and incredibly functional.

## Colony
Colony is a designer’s cooperative that serves as the downtown showroom for independent American designers. Jean Lin started Colony in 2014 and it’s just one block down from Uprise Art on Canal Street. We love being neighbors. During Design Week, Colony hosted movie nights, yoga classes, donut breaks and manicure parties.

Their open loft space is filled with light, plants, and typically great tunes. It’s like a little oasis of calm sitting above Canal. Jean curates furniture, lighting, wallpaper and textiles that all have a unifying aesthetic - clean lines, beautiful raw materials, and geometric shapes - and many of the pieces are made right here in New York.

## Uprise Art
I spend more time at Uprise Art than anywhere else, and I love coming to work every day.

Uprise Art is an online gallery for the next generation of art collectors. We represent contemporary emerging artists and help people find original one-of-a-kind artwork. Working surrounded by amazing pieces from our collection reminds me of why we do what we do.

It's great being downtown (Broadway and Canal) because collectors and interior designers stop in all the time to see new works, or to just say hi. More than half of our artists live and work in NYC, so I make studio visits or they’ll come by our office to catch up.

New York is the center of the art world, so in owning a gallery here, there’s the feeling that if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Pearl S. Buck said, “all things are possible until they are proven impossible.” I moved to NYC fourteen years ago because, like millions of other people, I knew it was a place where you could carve out your own little corner, and where the possibilities were endless.

Ayr, Colony, and Uprise Art all look at the creative landscape and consider how things can be done better.

By supporting independent businesses - where everything is on the line, teams are nimble, and resources are hard won rather than given - you’re making innovation possible.
