## Mizu
I think I’d have to start by talking about somewhere I frequent almost every week. Mizu on 59th and Park is a small, very New York City hairdresser - it’s standalone and not part of any kind of chain or franchise. Mizu is great because it’s truly a local business; the people who work there all live in the city. They employ something like thirty to forty people if you count the hairdressers who make their own hours and don’t work there full time. There are other hairdressers I’ll occasionally go to, but Mizu is close to me - it’s very convenient, I’m accustomed to it, and the services are good.

## Primola
Primola is a small, independently owned establishment on 2nd Ave between 64th and 65th. The gentleman who owns the place knows everybody who comes in, the food is always good, and whenever I walk in I’ll see at least a few people I know from the area. It’s impressive when a restaurant in this city can sustain itself for so long. As everyone knows, there are so many new restaurants that open up in the city every week...they’ll be hot for the first few months and nobody can get in, and then within one or two years most of them are gone. So it’s great to find ones that have solid legs beneath them. If you really want to start a restaurant in New York City, my advice would be to understand the neighborhood you’re in so you can carve out a niche that makes sense. Make it work for the neighborhood first, not the other way around. Bigger isn’t always better.

## Mme Eleanor’s Cleaners
Mme Eleanor’s is on 53rd and 1st. Again, it’s another one of these small, very specialized, and independently operated business that keep the city thriving. I’ve been going to them for over 30 years. It’s in the neighborhood, their turnaround and work ethic is good, so everything either goes to them or one other specialty cleaner that I use. Convenience is another big factor, but I’m not talking about the kind of convenience that you get with, say, an Amazon. Amazon brings convenience that has a lot of destructive side effects - the convenience that you get at something like Mme Eleanor’s is one that’s rooted in personal connection and familiarity.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Two things that really impacted small businesses in New York City were 9-11 and the downturn of 2008. These events completely changed people’s idea of what coming into the city meant. Quite frankly, a lot of people were frightened at that time and they slipped into this pattern of staying where they were...in Jersey or Connecticut - or even the outer boroughs - and small businesses experienced a lot of fallout from that.

I think what people have to remember is that you don’t get the same level of personalized connection and services with larger, chain businesses. There’s incomparable value to knowing the people you’re doing business with. That relationship affords you a level of service and convenience that you’ll never find at a big franchise. As a society, we’ve become so focused on our phones, on automation, on “efficiency,” on optimization, that we’ve started to lose a little bit of our humanity. I really do feel that it’s an ironically dark age that we’re in because of this. You know, I’m in the live events business, so it’s become increasingly clear to me that we’re one of the last ways and reasons for people to come together in real life and bond over something they all relate to. That’s a strange thing for me to consider, but I’ll always fight for that experience to thrive and be a part of our culture. Long live the live event space.
