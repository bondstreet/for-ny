## Orso
I remember the first time I went to Orso - I was working for Meg Simon and Fran Kumin right out of school as a casting assistant. You knew of Orso because it was kind of The Theater’s Place to Be - all of the stars and producers were always eating there. One night, Meg and Fran took me to dinner at Orso. I remember every moment of that experience and thinking to myself, “I can’t wait until I can afford to come here on my own and bring people here.”

Well, I’ve been a regular at Orso for about 20 years now and can safely say that I’ve had literally everything on the menu. Everything is consistently delicious. Additionally, it’s an establishment that’s really accommodating - I’ll have business meetings there, run in before heading to the theater, and regularly stop by with my family. The waiters have been there forever, the owners are the managers, everyone knows who you are, and we’ll always get a table when we need one. On top of all that, Orso’s in a fantastic location: it’s two blocks from my house on 44th, two blocks from my office on 43rd, and two blocks from every Broadway theater. While the convenience factor alone puts it over the top for me, what’s really amazing is that my entire family - whether it’s my wife, my kids, or my extended family - all of them absolutely love the food. It’s a great place to go at 6 o’clock before curtain, but also 11 o’clock after shows. Everything about Orso is a 10.

## Domus
Domus is a store on 44th street between 9th and 10th - it’s diagonally across the street from where I live. I’ve been a customer there for over 15 years. Of course, I first walked in because I wanted to support businesses on my block, but over the years I’ve continued to buy things at Domus because they really fulfill so many of my needs. It’s run and owned by two women, Nicki and Luisa (both of whom I wish I hung out with more), who’ve got incredible taste and curatorial minds. Most of what is stocked at Domus are home goods made by women in foreign (often developing) nations. You can tell how committed Nicki and Luisa are just by thinking about how difficult it must be to support these women and import their wares to the States. In my mind, something about that dedication elevates Domus beyond what retail typically is; it’s about so much more than just facilitating transactions.

I’ll always buy cards, baby gifts, and presents for family, friends, and clients at Domus. The greatest thing about the shop might be how much my dogs love it - at this point, it doesn’t matter what time I’m walking them. It could be 2 AM and if we’re anywhere close to Domus they’ll head right for the store and get upset that it’s closed.

## Fresh Cut Flowers, Inc.
Fresh Cut Flowers is my neighborhood florist. It’s run by a guy named Robert, who’s another individual with an impeccable curatorial eye. I don’t know much about flowers besides the fact that my wife loves them and I appreciate them deeply on an aesthetic level. So while I might not know all of the names of every flower in the store, I can always call and they seem to intuitively know exactly what I need, whether it’s for a business thing or my home. I’ll say “I want something like this for something on Monday night - one that’s wild, one that’s red” and the most amazing bouquets will show up that are completely in line with what I had in mind. It’s surreal. I think that’s one of the greatest things about building a relationship with a local business - you develop a shorthand with the people who run it.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
Because I live very close to where I work, I’m doubly conscious of supporting the people who run businesses in my neighborhood. I want independent business owners on my block to flourish because behind them are human beings who I depend on and have relationships with. I’d be heartbroken if they weren’t around. Independent businesses like Domus, Orso, and Fresh Cut Flowers make neighborhoods healthy; they ground them. They give communities vibrancy and provide neighbors with places to get together - there’s a real sense of security in that. I’ve said this several times throughout this interview, but it’s wonderful to be able to see how your patronage can help a business thrive - in dealing with an independent business owner, I feel like you usually get back even more than you give.
