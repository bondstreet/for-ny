## Frankel’s

Frankel's is a great new addition to Greenpoint, where it seems all the new restaurants are just clones of the same 'Rustic-American' model (read: $20 cheeseburger). It was opened by musician friends of mine, and serves up 100% legit Jewish deli food: succulent whitefish, smoked salmon, gleaming bagels, and all the proper fixings. A perfect place to take parents or friends visiting from out of town to come bask in the sunny window seat, get in some good Brooklyn peoplewatching, and slowly put away an 8" tall sandwich.

## La Nortena

La Nortena is the neighborhood restaurant I eat at the most. It's a little hole-in-the-wall Mexican spot that's open all night, which makes it ideal after a late night out or in the studio. My order is always the same: cheese enchiladas with green sauce and black beans. They don't even ask me what I'm ordering anymore. The guys who run it are so sweet, and they always have Mexican soap operas on the TV.

## Yelena’s Shoe Repair

Yelena's is like a portal into old New York. Yelena himself is a beloved character in Williamsburg- sometimes he'll crack a dry joke, sometimes I get a fatherly scolding for leaving my shoes there for a month while on tour. He works out of a small, shoe-polish-stained stall from 7:30-7 every day by himself, always does a beautiful job, and the prices are extremely low- most of my repairs come in around $5-7. I hope this place always stays in business! 

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Independent business give NYC the wonderful character that makes it different than any other city in the world. They create neighborhoods, jobs with room to grow, and are usually a much more creative and efficient use of real estate than the enormous chains that come in, with menus and inventories based on mass-scale figures and their huge amounts of unused space. Independent businesses in NYC are the manifestation of tons of passion and vision by their owners, which leads to richer and more interesting experiences for everyone. They're where you find the real NYC.
