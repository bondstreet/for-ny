## Ted Muehling

Because his creations are exquisite and because he chooses NOT to be found everywhere.

## Dashwood Books

Every time I visit, I walk out learning about someone new.

## Top Hat

Top Hat is on Broome. The store always makes me feel happy. I always walk out with something for everyone...me, my husband, my kids, and even things for people Iâ€™ll encounter in the future!

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

Without supporting independent/local businesses, creativity, discovery and the unknown would disappear.  You wouldn't need to travel because what you experience in one city would begin to look and feel the same everywhere.
