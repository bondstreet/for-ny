## The Strand

I’m a big fan of books and local bookshops. Over the years, I’ve seen too many independent bookshops close in the wake of amazon.com undercutting prices. The Strand is still here with an excellent selection of art books and a great space to get lost in; a true NYC staple.

## Local NYC Restaurants

Old and new, you have to love the incredible variety of excellent food available at all price points throughout NYC. Too many great ones to name.

## Art Galleries

Deitch Projects stayed downtown and continues to represent all angles of creative culture/life.
Dia, Walter DeMaria’s Earth Room, and The Broken Kilometer have been in Soho since the 80’s. Hidden gems to this day.
The Noguchi Museum - An absolute gem of a museum that is a must see! It’s a bit out of the way and too often overlooked. Well worth the trip!

## Why is it important to support independent business?

Independent business bring originality and variety in a world that’s becoming increasingly homogenized. It’s not always about cost. Independent business stand for flavor, personality, and style. Supporting independent business is supporting people!
