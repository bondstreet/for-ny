## Captured Tracks

Captured Tracks is one of my favorite labels. Mike put together the shop as a pretty modest venture early on; since then, he’s brought on some new partners and now they’re this real powerhouse. They get amazing collections; recently, they came up on a huge collection of early 80s, UK indie, Factory Records, and early dance stuff. I find their whole perspective really cool because it’s such an agnostic outlook on music - you’ll find everything there. I never know what I’ll find there so I associate Captured with a real sense of discovery. It’s also great that it’s literally underground.

## Co-Op 87

Co-Op 87, I think, came out of the Mexican Summer family. I don’t know what the space used to be before they took over, but it’s cool how it looks like it was carved out of the existing architecture around it. To me, it feels like record stores I used to go to when I was a kid. Ben’s a real maven; his perspectives and selection are really peerless - he’ll hold a  lot of stuff like boogie, drum-n-bass, reggae, hip hop records that are all rooted in dance DNA. He helped me out bigtime when I was going through this original 90s R&B records kick; a lot of them weren’t available on vinyl for a while, so he found me a bunch of Jamaican bootlegs of Boyz II Men and Toni Braxton stuff with like scans of the CDs blown up on the covers. Co-Op is cool because it goes super accessible and esoteric at once.

## Academy Records

Academy is like the Chez Panisse of record stores - everyone who works there goes on to start their own record stores. There’s almost a mini-Amoeba vibe to it; you really feel like you could spend hours there. Some big, big records will always hit those walls - I got the first two Kraftwerk records there. Whenever DJs or artists come in from out of town, I always take them to Academy. You’ll always find some joints you never knew you wanted, but played in that context it makes total sense. That’s exactly what a good store should do - make you see things differently than you would have before. I take bigger risks with purchases in there because I feel like they’ve already combed the sand a bit.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?

I don’t think bigger companies are bad, per se, but it’s about having options. A healthy neighborhood will have a constellation of smaller businesses balancing the big boxes out, and the community usually ends up better for it. Also, you really learn how to run a company when you work at a small business. All of the guys and girls who work at Ghostly have their own side labels and projects - hopefully what we’ve done is shown them that running their own thing is a viable pursuit. If you don’t have a functional independent business to refer to, how would you know that that’s something you can do on your own?
