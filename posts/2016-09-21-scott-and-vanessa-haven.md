## American Deli Market
S: American Deli Market’s been in this neighborhood - well, in this very spot - forever. It’s the bodega and the pizza spot next door. They’re truly a Greenpoint staple. When we moved onto the block, they were super supportive of us right away. Connecting with Yvette and the whole crew at the deli was important to us because we wanted to be a business that has a reciprocal relationship with the community. This is definitely the case with all of the businesses on our block, but we always make sure to help each other out whenever the other person needs something. It gives the whole area a great energy.

V: Right - that support system is essential to all of us. What was really nice was how they approached us while we were all over the place trying to get moved in while I was pregnant. Yvette would see me walking up and down the block and she’d be like, “Hey! Welcome! Do you guys need help with anything?” I think she was pretty excited to see another Spanish person opening up a business in the neighborhood. We clicked immediately and have become really great friends since.

## In God We Trust
S: Same deal here. Shana’s had that business for over a decade. The spot we went to around the corner is where they manufacture everything. It’s also one of their retail locations. Her line is quintessentially New York. She designs and makes everything here - she’s been doing it for a long, long time. When we moved onto the block, she was so receptive to us and we hit it off immediately. We’ve been bugging her for advice ever since. Shana always has the answers to things we don’t know - it’s really inspiring to be around her and learn from what she’s doing with In God We Trust.

## Kickstarter
S: Yancey, one of the co-founders of Kickstarter, has been coming in here since they moved their office to Greenpoint. 

V: We did his wedding and that really solidified our friendship. I love what that company does on a social level. 

S: This is fairly common knowledge, but they’ve restructured their company to be socially focused and have gone on to help a lot of people like us get off the ground. Most importantly, they’re super genuine about what they do, which is something that doesn’t always happen with the pressures and ambitions native to the tech industry. So, while it’s certainly not a SMALL business anymore, I’d say we count them as pretty solid neighbors and a company that has been great about helping a lot of us (independent business owners) achieve our goals. They created a platform that has changed the way entrepreneurs introduce their businesses to the world and how we can seek and raise capital while retaining ownership of our vision. 

V: For being a bigger company that practically eclipses a lot of the other businesses in Greenpoint (as far as scale is concerned), they’re really mindful neighbors, as well.

## Why is it important to support independent businesses?
S: What we wanted to demonstrate with our selection of businesses was that how each of them are so important to the ecosystem, regardless of scale and composition. So whether it’s a spot that literally services your street or one that operates on a global level, supporting independent businesses is voting with your dollar. It’s you saying that you’d rather support businesses that are run by people who you identify with. It’s saying that you care about the values they push forward and building a relationship with a business. 

V: That’s certainly what we hope our customers feel about Homecoming whenever they come by the shop!
