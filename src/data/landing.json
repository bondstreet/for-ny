Our bars, our laundries, our hot dog sellers and our delicatessens, our bodegas, our dollar stores, our hardware stories, hell, our haberdasheries. These businesses have served New York City with dignity and distinction since this city was built—some are quiet, others make noise; some last a week, or a month, while others have lasted over a century, and are still kicking. <br><br> “For New York” sets out to share a few of their stories. Together they stand for what Bond Street aspires to do: Advocate, promote, protect, and celebrate the small businesses that make our culture great, that make it so indelibly human, and that also make an incredibly strong case for their sanctity in the lifeblood of New York City, and the world that so loves their stories, too. Here’s to them."
