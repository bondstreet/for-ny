    "description": "“For New York” represents the humble, eternal spirit of the New York City merchant. The small business. These businesses have served New York City with dignity and distinction since this city was built—some are quiet, others make noise; some last a week, or a month, while others have lasted over a century, and are still kicking. “For New York” sets out to share a few of their stories."
